# Gaurav Tuli Portfolio

This repository hosts a static personal site inspired by the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) design system. The
landing page showcases signature initiatives with card-based summaries, while detailed project pages provide deep dives into
biosurveillance, clinical decision support, and maternal-infant informatics work.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Hero landing page with project cards styled using the al-folio design language.
- `assets/css/` – Theme stylesheet from al-folio and a custom layer for layout refinements.
- `<n>_project/index.html` – Individual project narratives with enhanced typography and responsive layouts.

To preview locally, serve the repository with any static file server (for example, `python -m http.server`) and open
`http://localhost:8000` in a browser.
