<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Official gun violence data was delayed and fragmented, hindering timely awareness of ongoing incidents.
        </li>
<li>
         The public lacked an accessible, up-to-date source for localized gun violence information and trends.
        </li>
<li>
         Policymakers had insufficient interim data between official reports to gauge the effects of policy changes on gun violence.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Developed an interactive web dashboard that combines multi-source data (social media posts, news reports, and Google search trends) on gun incidents in near real time.
        </li>
<li>
         Implemented machine learning to categorize gun-related tweets (e.g., distinguishing incident reports vs. discussions) and to classify news articles by type of incident.
        </li>
<li>
         Geocoded all data to the state level and integrated official metrics (e.g., gun death rates, background check stats) to provide contextual insights alongside the live incident feeds.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Multi-Source Ingestion: Pipelines continuously pulled data from Twitter (streaming API for gun-related keywords), Google News feeds (for relevant articles), and Google Trends (for spikes in gun-related searches).
        </li>
<li>
         ML Classification Pipeline: Automated tagging of content – grouping tweets into four topical categories (e.g., incident, policy, opinion, other) and news articles into seven categories of incidents – for structured analysis.
        </li>
<li>
         Human-in-the-Loop Curation: A small analyst team reviewed the machine outputs to verify classifications, remove duplicate reports, and annotate developing stories, ensuring data quality and reliability.
        </li>
<li>
         Geolocation Engine: Each tweet and news item was mapped to a U.S. state (using text location cues and a geocoding API) so that the dashboard could display state-by-state incident summaries.
        </li>
<li>
         Dashboard Front-End: A public-facing map and timeline interface updated live, showing each state’s recent incidents, trends over time, and comparisons to official statistics, all in one place.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Tracked ~540,000 gun-related tweets and ~1,600 news articles per month during 2015–2016, demonstrating the system’s ability to handle high-volume, real-time data.
        </li>
<li>
         Deployed the public site Gunviolencemap.org, giving citizens and officials a live, interactive view of gun violence trends by state (a first-of-its-kind public tool).
        </li>
<li>
         Project garnered national attention: it was presented at SXSW 2016 and featured by media outlets (e.g., Wired, KQED) for its novel approach, thereby raising awareness and informing public debate on gun violence.

<h2>
        Cross-Project Capabilities
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Real-Time Social Data Mining: Techniques for live social data tracking developed here were later applied to health domains (digital disease surveillance).
        </li>
<li>
         Reusable Pipelines: The Twitter ingestion and classification pipeline was repurposed in other projects (e.g., patient experience sentiment analysis in healthcare).
        </li>
<li>
         Integrated Data Dashboards: Experience merging diverse data streams (social media, open data, official stats) into unified platforms is leveraged in projects requiring multi-source analytics.
