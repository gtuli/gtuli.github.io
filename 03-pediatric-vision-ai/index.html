        At a Glance
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Created an iPad-based gaze-tracking app (“Vision Ninja”) to objectively measure visual acuity in infants and toddlers.
        </li>
<li>
         Cut infant eye exam time by ~30%, replacing slow manual methods with a quick, engaging digital test.
        </li>
<li>
         Leveraged machine vision (OpenCV) to assess eyesight in pre-verbal children, enabling detection of vision issues at ages where standard eye charts fail.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Standard infant vision exams (like observing if a baby follows objects or using cards) are slow, subjective, and often imprecise.
        </li>
<li>
         Subtle vision problems (e.g., mild lazy eye or focus issues) can go undetected until a child is older and able to cooperate with traditional tests, missing a crucial early treatment window.
        </li>
<li>
         Exams for toddlers can be stressful and inefficient – keeping a young child’s attention is hard, and lengthy appointments often yield incomplete or unreliable results due to fatigue or fussiness.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Developed a tablet “game” that displays high-contrast shapes (optotypes) and uses the device’s front camera with OpenCV to track the infant’s eye movements in real time.
        </li>
<li>
         The app employs an adaptive algorithm: it shows a shape and detects if the baby’s gaze fixes on it. If the child looks, the shape gets smaller next round; if not, it gets bigger – homing in on the smallest visible size (like a digital eye chart).
        </li>
<li>
         The testing process is mostly automated – the examiner just starts the test and the system adjusts stimulus size, logs each response, and determines the infant’s visual acuity threshold without requiring verbal input from the child.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Device &amp; Vision Components: An iPad with its camera runs the app; OpenCV-based gaze detection identifies whether the infant looks at each shown shape within a set time window.
        </li>
<li>
         Adaptive Staircase Algorithm: The app’s logic dynamically adjusts the optotype size up or down based on the infant’s responses, following a staircase strategy to pinpoint the smallest discernible shape.
        </li>
<li>
         Minimal Manual Interaction: The interface is simple for clinicians – enter basic patient info and tap start. The system handles presenting stimuli and deciding when to stop (once acuity threshold is found), while logging all gaze responses.
        </li>
<li>
         Data Logging: Every stimulus presentation and outcome is recorded internally. These logs can be analyzed (in Python) to fine-tune parameters (e.g., how long to display shapes, how long a “meaningful gaze” must last) and improve future test versions.
        </li>
<li>
         Prototype Platform: Built as an iOS app (Swift) with integration of OpenCV libraries. The design emphasizes engaging visuals (simple shapes, sounds) to maintain the baby’s attention and uses on-device processing for immediate feedback.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Early prototype testing showed exam times reduced by roughly one-third, making the vision test much faster and less taxing for infants and parents.
        </li>
<li>
         Provided quantitative eye exam results for infants (e.g., exact smallest shape recognized), replacing subjective judgments with objective metrics that can be tracked over time.
        </li>
<li>
         Promises earlier identification of vision issues (like amblyopia or high refractive errors) in babies, allowing interventions (glasses, patching) to begin during a crucial developmental window rather than waiting years.
        </li>

<h2>
        Cross-Project Capabilities
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Human-centered design of AI tools: this project shows the importance of tailoring technology to end-users (babies and clinicians), a user-first approach that Dr. Tuli applies when designing clinician dashboards or patient-facing AI tools in other projects.
        </li>
<li>
         Real-time signal processing: experience gained in processing video feedback within seconds parallels his work in streaming data analysis for outbreak detection and ICU monitoring, demonstrating proficiency in developing time-sensitive analytics.
        </li>
<li>
         Rapid prototyping &amp; stakeholder buy-in: by building a compelling prototype with clear “wow factor,” he secured stakeholder support – a tactic he repeated in other initiatives (e.g., quick demos for the mother-infant dashboard) to accelerate funding and adoption.
