         Created a machine learning–based composite biomarker panel for accurate food allergy risk assessment.

         Outperformed any single test, reducing unnecessary oral food challenges and associated risks.

         Improved patient safety by identifying which children can safely undergo allergen exposure versus those at high risk.

        The Problem
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Standard allergy tests (IgE, skin prick) often yield ambiguous results and can’t predict true allergic reactions reliably.
        </li>
        <li>
         The gold-standard oral food challenge is risky, resource-intensive, and used sparingly, leaving many patients undiagnosed or in limbo.
        </li>
        <li>
         Rising food allergy rates heighten the need for better diagnostics to distinguish truly allergic patients without putting them through dangerous procedures.
        </li>
       </ul>

       <h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Built an ML model that combines multiple inputs (specific IgE levels, skin test results, patient history) to predict if a patient is truly allergic or likely tolerant.
        </li>
        <li>
         Trained on real hospital data (patients with known oral challenge outcomes) so the model “learns” the patterns of feature combinations that signal a true allergy.
        </li>
        <li>
         Designed a prototype pipeline (“ML-Allergy”) integrated with the EHR: it pulls a patient’s lab results and history, runs the ML risk algorithm, and outputs a risk score with guidance to clinicians.
        </li>
       </ul>

        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Six-component ML pipeline from data extraction to decision support. It automatically pulls relevant lab results and clinical history from the EHR data warehouse via ETL processes.
        </li>
        <li>
         Feature engineering handles ~20+ predictors (IgE, ratios, symptoms, etc.), accommodates missing data, and uses regularization to rank important features and avoid overfit.
        </li>
        <li>
         Iterative model training with cross-validation tests various algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to maximize predictive AUC while maintaining generalizability.
        </li>
        <li>
         The final model achieved high performance (AUC ~0.96) and was configured to emphasize safety (e.g., tuning thresholds to minimize false negatives for allergies).
        </li>
        <li>
         The output is presented in a clinician-friendly format within workflow: a risk score (“High risk – 85% chance of reaction”) along with key contributing factors, seamlessly delivered alongside existing lab reports.
        </li>
       </ul>

       <h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The ML risk model reached ~96% accuracy (AUC ~0.96) in validation, far exceeding the predictive power of any single test, which translates to much more confident clinical decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
         Combining multiple test results proved its value: the model clearly separated allergic vs. tolerant patients, confirming that multiple weak indicators together create a strong signal.
        </li>
        <li>
         In practice, this enables doctors to avoid unnecessary and risky food challenges for low-risk patients and to focus resources on those truly at risk, improving safety and reducing patient anxiety.
