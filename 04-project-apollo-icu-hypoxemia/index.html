<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Dangerous drops in blood oxygen (hypoxemia) can occur between intermittent arterial blood gas tests, since these invasive checks are done only a few times a day.
        </li>
<li>
         Pulse oximeter readings (SpO₂) are continuous but become unreliable at the top end (97–100% SpO₂) – they can’t distinguish a safe patient from one with dangerously high oxygen levels.
        </li>
<li>
         Existing surrogate formulas for PaO₂ are often inaccurate, especially at saturation extremes, and don’t adapt to individual patient differences, making clinicians hesitant to trust them.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Collected a large dataset of paired ABG measurements and bedside monitor readings (~52,000 samples) from ICU patients, and used it to develop better estimation models.
        </li>
<li>
         Explored machine learning approaches (including neural networks using inputs like recent SpO₂ trends and heart rate) and also optimized a conventional oxygenation equation by tuning physiological parameters to fit real patient data.
        </li>
<li>
         Selected a new empirically tuned equation (“Sauthier ePaO₂”) that provided the best accuracy. Implemented it for continuous use: the ICU monitor (or a linked computer) takes in streaming SpO₂ and heart rate and computes an estimated PaO₂ every minute, displaying it to clinicians and triggering alerts if oxygen drops.
        </li>
<li>
         Built in real-time quality control: the algorithm watches the difference between pulse oximeter heart rate and EKG heart rate as a noise indicator – if they diverge, it treats the SpO₂ data as unreliable and adjusts or flags accordingly.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Data Pipeline: Retrieved high-frequency vital signs data around each ABG draw from two hospitals’ systems (merging data logged every 5 seconds from one system and every 1 second from another, standardized to 5-second intervals). Stored all combined data in a PostgreSQL database for analysis.
        </li>
<li>
         Analysis &amp; Modeling Environment: Used Python and R extensively (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Keras/TensorFlow) to clean data, engineer features (e.g., recent SpO₂ averages, slopes, heart-rate disparities), and train/test multiple candidate models.
        </li>
<li>
         Model Evaluation: Employed rigorous statistical evaluation – generated Bland-Altman plots to assess agreement between estimated and actual PaO₂, calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (agreement), and examined error across different SpO₂ ranges to ensure reliability even at high saturations.
        </li>
<li>
         Deployment Design: Specified how the final algorithm would run on existing ICU monitors: a lightweight script or plugin continuously ingests real-time vitals, applies the estimation formula, and outputs a refreshed PaO₂ estimate every few seconds. This can feed into the bedside monitor display (trend graphs, ARDS index calculations) and alarm systems for immediate clinical use.
        </li>
<li>
         Safety Considerations: Built into the design fail-safes like capping displayed values beyond validated ranges (e.g., instead of an implausible number at extreme highs, show an indicator like “PaO₂ very high”) and ignoring data during sensor disconnections or extreme noise, ensuring the tool would be trusted by clinicians.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         The optimized estimator provided sensible, stable PaO₂ readings even when SpO₂ was 100%, overcoming the “infinite reading” problem of traditional equations and giving clinicians meaningful data at the high end of oxygenation.
        </li>
<li>
         Continuous monitoring enabled earlier detection of hypoxemia trends – for example, the system could alert if a patient’s oxygen was quietly deteriorating between blood gas tests, allowing interventions (like ventilator adjustments) sooner and improving ARDS management by tracking severity in real time.
        </li>
<li>
         The work was published in Critical Care Explorations (2021) and has since been cited in multiple studies, influencing the field of digital critical care. It provided a blueprint for integrating predictive algorithms into ICU workflows, with discussions underway to pilot the estimator in a real ICU setting.

        Cross-Project Capabilities
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Translating data science research into a clinical tool: experience in going from retrospective analysis to a validated model ready for real-world use (as done here) is directly applicable to other projects where ML models must be deployment-ready (e.g., the allergy risk model or mother-infant dashboard logic).
        </li>
<li>
         Time-series data expertise: skills in handling and analyzing high-frequency time-series (ICU monitor streams) are transferable to other domains, including real-time social media feeds in outbreak surveillance or sensor data in IoT health projects.
        </li>
<li>
         Multi-site data integration: learned to standardize and combine data across different hospital systems, a capability that proved valuable in later projects focused on data interoperability (such as linking records in the mother-infant health information exchange project).
