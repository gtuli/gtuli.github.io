            <h2>Key Questions Addressed</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Is Noninvasive Estimation Feasible Across All Ranges? Can we create a formula or model to accurately estimate PaO₂ from readily available noninvasive data (like SpO₂, heart rate) even when SpO₂ is high (&gt;97%)? This addresses whether we can overcome the known inaccuracies of existing models in the upper saturation range.</li>
              <li>Model vs. Classical Equations: How will a data-driven or hybrid model (e.g., machine learning or empirically optimized equation) compare to traditional theoretical equations (like the Severinghaus equation) in predicting PaO₂? Essentially, can we do better by leveraging ICU monitoring data and ML than the decades-old formulas?</li>
              <li>Impact on Oxygenation Index and ARDS Classification: If we can estimate PaO₂ continuously, can we also compute the Oxygenation Index (OI) continuously (OI = FiO₂ * mean airway pressure * 100 / PaO₂)? Will this improve classification of hypoxemia severity and potentially ARDS criteria in real-time, compared to using the Oxygen Saturation Index (which uses SpO₂)?</li>
              <li>Generality and Validation: Will an estimator developed in one ICU population (Boston Children’s) hold up in another (Sainte-Justine in Montreal)? This question checks if the model is generalizable across different patient cohorts and settings.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Undetected Hypoxemia Periods: Because continuous PaO₂ isn’t available, ICU staff rely on SpO₂ trends and intermittent ABGs. However, significant episodes of hypoxemia can go unnoticed if they occur between ABG draws. For instance, a patient’s lungs might deteriorate and recover within a span of an hour, but if SpO₂ stayed above 95%, clinicians might not realize PaO₂ dropped dangerously low in between.</li>
              <li>Inaccuracy of Existing Surrogates: Several mathematical models exist to approximate PaO₂ from SpO₂ (and sometimes other vital signs), but they have important limitations. They often assume a fixed dissociation curve (which can vary by patient condition), and they break down at SpO₂ = 100% (many equations produce infinite or undefined PaO₂ there). Additionally, critical illness factors (like changes in patient P50 – hemoglobin affinity) make one-size equations inaccurate.</li>
              <li>Data Complexity: ICU monitors generate a flood of data every second (SpO₂, heart rate, etc.). Extracting useful insights (like predicting ABG values) from this high-frequency data is nontrivial. Noise from sensors (e.g., motion artifact in pulse ox) can further complicate any estimation algorithm. The problem was to filter and use this data effectively.</li>
              <li>Clinical Skepticism: Clinicians are used to ABG values as the trusted source. Convincing them to rely on or even use a continuous estimator requires that it be proven accurate and robust. So, the challenge included not just technical accuracy but achieving a level of reliability that could influence clinical practice.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Importance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Better ARDS Management: ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) criteria and severity are partly defined by PaO₂/FiO₂ ratios. Continuous PaO₂ estimates allow continuous calculation of such ratios, potentially catching when a patient transitions into or out of ARDS ranges in real-time. This could trigger earlier escalation of therapy or, conversely, avoidance of unnecessary interventions if the patient is improving.</li>
              <li>Titration of Oxygen: Clinicians aim to avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia. Continuous PaO₂ would give a more nuanced picture, helping to fine-tune oxygen delivery. For example, if two patients both have SpO₂ 100%, one might have PaO₂ of 100 mmHg and another 250 mmHg – the second patient could tolerate weaning FiO₂, but SpO₂ alone wouldn’t reveal that. The estimator provides that insight.</li>
              <li>Reducing ABG Draws: If clinicians gain confidence in the continuous estimator, it could reduce the frequency of painful and anemia-contributing blood draws. Fewer ABGs mean less blood loss (important in neonates/pediatrics) and lower lab costs, and it frees up staff time.</li>
              <li>Knowledge Advancement: From a scientific standpoint, this project advances understanding of the SpO₂–PaO₂ relationship in critical illness. It used a large dataset to empirically optimize and evaluate models, providing evidence on which factors (e.g., heart rate differences indicating signal noise) significantly affect estimation. This contributes to critical care physiology knowledge and might inform future monitor designs.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Data-Driven Model Development: The team gathered a large dataset: over 52,000 paired ABG readings and corresponding monitor data from ~3,252 ICU patients (development cohort), plus ~12,000 pairs from 926 patients in an external validation cohort. They used this to both train machine learning models and to fit an empirical regression equation that adjusts a known physiological model (Hill’s equation) with optimal parameters for ICU patients.</li>
              <li>Machine Learning Approaches: Three kinds of neural networks were tested as potential estimators:</li>
              <li>A simple feed-forward neural net,</li>
              <li>A recurrent-type network to consider time-series trends,</li>
              <li>A more complex deep network. These models took in features like current SpO₂, recent SpO₂ trend, pulse rate, and the difference between pulse rate and ECG heart rate (an indicator of signal quality). They were trained to output the estimated PaO₂.</li>
              <li>Empirically Optimized Equation: In parallel, the team worked with the conventional oxyhemoglobin dissociation formula. They identified key parameters (P50, Hill coefficient n, etc.) that needed tuning for critically ill children. Using an exhaustive search over plausible ranges, they found the combination of parameters that best fit the actual patient data. The resulting “Sauthier ePaO₂ equation” is a simpler mathematical model that can be implemented easily in practice (no complex computation needed).</li>
              <li>Continuous Monitoring Implementation: With a model chosen (ultimately the empirical equation performed best overall, see Results), the solution was implemented as follows: for each patient, the bedside monitor or a connected computer takes the streaming SpO₂ and heart rate. Every minute (or continuously), it computes an estimated PaO₂ using the formula or model. This value can then be displayed on a screen or fed into alert systems. For instance, a trend graph of estimated PaO₂ could be shown in the ICU alongside other vitals, or an alarm could trigger if estimated PaO₂ drops below a threshold for a certain duration.</li>
              <li>Validation on External Data: The final model was locked and then tested on the Montreal cohort data (which the model had never seen). This external validation was critical to ensure the solution wasn’t overfitted. The performance metrics on the validation set were almost as good as on the development set, confirming generalizability.</li>
              <li>Noise Mitigation: The solution incorporated a clever quality control: it uses the difference between pulse oximeter heart rate and EKG heart rate as a real-time gauge of data reliability. If this difference is large, it signals the SpO₂ reading might be erroneous (e.g., due to motion). The model accounts for this by, for example, not relying on a single noisy SpO₂ reading or by adjusting the confidence interval of the estimate when noise is detected.</li>
              <li>Deployment Consideration: The research was done retrospectively, but the next step outlined was to integrate the estimator into a clinical decision support module. This could be done via the ICU’s existing patient monitoring system software (e.g., a plugin or script within the monitor that applies the formula continuously), since it only needs vital sign inputs available in real-time. The lightweight nature of the empirical equation means it’s easily deployable on the monitor hardware.</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Data Pipeline: The project required extracting high-frequency data around each ABG event. For each ABG sample in the dataset, a time window of monitor data (−20 to +10 minutes) around the ABG draw was pulled from the archived streams. Data from two systems were combined:</li>
              <li>BCH used an Etiometry T3 database that logged vitals every 5 seconds.</li>
              <li>Sainte-Justine had a custom system (1-second data), which was down-sampled to 5-second intervals to match.</li>
              <li>Database and Processing: All this data was stored in a local PostgreSQL 12 database for analysis. Python (v3.7) and R (v3.6) scripts were used to analyze data and train models, with heavy use of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and sci-kit learn, as well as Keras/TensorFlow for the neural networks.</li>
              <li>Feature Engineering: From the raw data, features included:</li>
              <li>Mean SpO₂ over the last X minutes before ABG (they found the last 1 minute average worked best as a predictor),</li>
              <li>Median SpO₂ or other aggregates,</li>
              <li>Trend (slope of SpO₂ over last few minutes),</li>
              <li>Current FiO₂ and vent settings were considered but interestingly, the final model for PaO₂ didn’t require FiO₂ since OI calculation is separate (FiO₂ is used in OI after obtaining PaO₂).</li>
              <li>Pulse rate vs heart rate difference as mentioned.</li>
              <li>Model Training &amp; Selection: The architecture for model development was typical: the data was divided, models were cross-validated internally, and then the best was chosen for external testing. They also plotted Bland-Altman diagrams for each model to visualize bias and limits of agreement.</li>
              <li>Performance Analysis: Several performance metrics were computed:</li>
              <li>Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between estimated and actual PaO₂ (as a measure of agreement),</li>
              <li>Bias (mean error) and Limits of Agreement from Bland-Altman analysis,</li>
              <li>Error stratified by SpO₂ range (because performance differed when SpO₂ ≤97% vs &gt;97%),</li>
              <li>For the OI classification, Cohen’s kappa to compare agreement in classifying hypoxemia severity using estimated PaO₂ vs using saturation-based index.</li>
              <li>Integration into CDSS: The envisioned architecture in practice is a piece of software running in the background of the ICU’s patient monitoring system. It continuously ingests the real-time vitals, applies the estimation algorithm (which could be as simple as plugging into the empirical equation: a few multiplications, etc.), and outputs an estimated PaO₂ value every few seconds or minutes. This value can feed:</li>
              <li>A graphical trend on the monitor,</li>
              <li>Automatic calculations of OI (since FiO₂ and vent pressure are known from the ventilator data) displayed to clinicians,</li>
              <li>Alerts (e.g., if estimated OI crosses a threshold indicating ARDS, or if PaO₂ &lt; a certain mmHg for a period).</li>
              <li>Safety Checks: The architecture includes safety checks such as “do not extrapolate beyond reasonable range.” For example, if SpO₂ is 100%, the model still gives a finite PaO₂ (unlike classical equations that might go to infinity), but the system might indicate “PaO₂ likely high” rather than a specific number if beyond validated range. Additionally, during times of sensor disconnection or extreme noise (e.g., patient on cardiopulmonary bypass, where pulse ox might not be valid), the system can detect that conditions are out of bounds and suspend the estimation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results and Impacts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Improved Accuracy vs. Prior Models: The new Sauthier-Tuli estimated PaO₂ model showed the highest agreement with actual ABG values among all methods tested. It achieved an ICC of ~0.38 in the validation cohort, significantly higher than classic models (which were ~0.35 or lower). While an ICC of 0.38 might seem modest, in the context of noisy physiological data it was a notable improvement, and the bias was near zero (essentially no systematic over- or under-estimation).</li>
              <li>Better Hypoxemia Classification: Using the continuously estimated PaO₂ to compute Oxygenation Index (OI) resulted in much better agreement with true hypoxemia status than using the Oxygenation Saturation Index (OSI, which relies on SpO₂). Specifically, for moderate hypoxemia (SpO₂ ≤97%), κ (kappa) was 0.79 with estimated PaO₂ vs 0.60 with OSI. For near-normal saturations, κ was 0.58 vs 0.52. These improvements mean the estimator can more reliably categorize patients into severity buckets, which is clinically important for ARDS definitions and tracking patient progress.</li>
              <li>Continuous Validity Across Range: The solution eliminated the infinite/undefined problem at SpO₂ 100%. It provided sensible estimates even at high saturations, enabling continuous monitoring across the full physiological range. For example, it could distinguish a patient at SpO₂ 100% on low support (likely truly well-oxygenated with PaO₂ maybe ~100 mmHg) versus on high support (might have PaO₂ ~200+ mmHg, indicating reserves). This is something earlier equations could not do.</li>
              <li>Noise Handling: The analysis confirmed that when the pulse vs ECG heart rate discrepancy was ≥3%, the predictive model’s performance dropped (ICC from ~0.75 to 0.44 in one sub-analysis). By recognizing this, the implemented system can flag when data is unreliable. In practice, this means nurses and doctors won’t be misled by spurious readings – the system might display a message or confidence interval indicating lower confidence during those times. This aspect increases clinician trust in the tool because it “knows its limits.”</li>
              <li>Clinical Impact Potential: Having proven the concept, this approach is on track to influence ICU monitoring. Clinicians and biomedical engineers in the ICU can use this model to augment patient monitors, giving a new vital sign: estimated PaO₂. In time, this could become a standard displayed value in ICUs (some advanced ICU monitors now are starting to include calculated values like this). The impact is a more informed decision-making process – for instance, a subtle downward trend in estimated PaO₂ overnight might prompt an earlier intervention in the morning rounds, rather than waiting for a blood gas.</li>
              <li>Recognition and Publication: This project’s findings were published in a peer-reviewed journal (Crit Care Explor, 2021) and being open-access, it gained wide visibility. It has been cited by subsequent studies looking to implement machine learning in critical care oxygenation management. The publication and its data also provided a framework that other researchers can use to validate or build upon – a few groups have since tried neural network approaches for similar aims, citing this work as a foundation.</li>
              <li>Towards Real-world Deployment: As a next step, Boston Children’s Hospital’s ICU considered running the estimator in shadow mode (i.e., live but not visible to clinicians) to further test its real-time performance and see how often it would trigger alerts or how it correlates with clinical events. If all goes well, integration into the clinical workflow could follow. This trajectory shows how the project is moving from research to tangible tool, potentially improving patient monitoring and safety in the near future.</li>

            <h2>Skills and Tools Used</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Big Data Handling: Managed and analyzed a large volume of ICU data (nearly 65,000 ABG instances with high-frequency time series). This required proficiency in SQL (PostgreSQL) and data manipulation in Python/R. Automated scripts were written to query and align data segments around ABG times, demonstrating strong data engineering skills.</li>
              <li>Statistical Modeling &amp; Analysis: Performed advanced statistical analyses: Bland-Altman analysis for agreement, calculation of confidence intervals via bootstrapping for ICC and bias, and hypothesis testing (e.g., comparing model biases with p-values). This ensured the results were rigorously validated and significant where claimed.</li>
              <li>Machine Learning &amp; Neural Networks: Used Keras/TensorFlow to design and train neural network models for regression. This involved selecting architectures, tuning hyperparameters, and preventing overfitting (using regularization or early stopping). Even though the final solution was a simpler empirical model, the ML exploration provided insights and a performance benchmark.</li>
              <li>Domain-Specific Knowledge: Deepened understanding of critical care physiology – Dr. Tuli had to familiarize with concepts like oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves, ARDS criteria, and how factors like temperature, pH (Bohr effect) can shift these curves. This knowledge was crucial in guiding the modeling (e.g., knowing which parameters to optimize and recognizing why prior models failed).</li>
              <li>Programming &amp; Scripting: Wrote efficient code for data extraction and real-time simulation. For example, a Python script might simulate the real-time monitoring by feeding one data point at a time into the model and logging outputs. Also, implemented the final empirical formula in a lightweight manner (could be as simple as a few lines of C or Python that could run on a bedside monitor).</li>
              <li>Collaboration &amp; Publication Writing: Collaborated with a multi-national team (the project involved researchers and MDs in both Boston and Montreal). Coordinated data sharing under appropriate agreements (ensuring PHI was protected). Dr. Tuli co-authored the journal publication, which involved writing sections of the manuscript and creating figures (such as plotting Bland-Altman plots and error distribution charts). This showcases scientific communication skills.</li>
              <li>Tool Validation: Used tools like MATLAB or R for plotting and verifying that the model works across subgroups (such as filtering the data by certain conditions to see if any bias emerges). He also likely used version control (Git) to manage analysis code and ensure reproducibility of the results, which is standard in such multi-institutional studies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cross-project Capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Translational Research to Implementation: This project is a textbook example of translating data science research into a clinical tool. Dr. Tuli’s experience here – going from retrospective data to a validated model poised for clinical integration – is directly applicable to other projects where algorithms must be robust enough for real-world use (like the allergy model or the mother-infant dashboard logic).</li>
              <li>Handling Time-Series Data: The expertise gained in analyzing and modeling time-series physiological data was leveraged in other works. For instance, it’s analogous to analyzing social media time-series in Pandemic Pulse, but here with a medical twist. This showcases flexibility in applying similar techniques (trend analysis, anomaly detection) in vastly different contexts (Twitter vs. ICU monitors).</li>
              <li>Multi-center Collaboration: Working across two hospitals (with different data systems) built skills in data standardization and remote collaboration – useful in the mother-infant HIE project as well, which deals with standardizing across systems. It shows he can navigate complex data integration challenges, a recurring theme in his portfolio.</li>
              <li>Regulatory Insight: Developing a clinical tool that affects patient care means understanding regulatory pathways (for devices/algorithms). Through discussions on deploying this estimator, Dr. Tuli gained insight into how clinical software is validated and possibly regulated (FDA etc.). This awareness is valuable for any future project that might require regulatory approval (e.g., an AI-driven diagnostic might need FDA clearance).</li>
              <li>Focus on Outcomes: The ICU project, like others, has patient outcomes at its core (reducing hypoxemia events, improving monitoring). Dr. Tuli consistently aligns his technical work with clear outcome metrics – whether it’s exam time reduction, diagnostic accuracy, or detection lead time. This outcome-driven approach is a capability that ensures his projects have impact and are viewed favorably by stakeholders (clinicians, administrators).</li>
              <li>Scholarly Contribution: Being an academic publication, this project adds to Dr. Tuli’s list of contributions (30+ papers), reinforcing his ability to conduct rigorous research that gets peer recognition. The scholarly rigor (data-driven, peer-reviewed) underpins many of his projects, even those not formally published, lending credibility and trust when implementing them in high-stakes environments.</li>

            <h2>Published Papers/Tools</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Journal Publication: Sauthier M, Tuli G, Jouvet P, Brownstein JS, Randolph AG. “Estimated PaO₂: A Continuous and Noninvasive Method to Estimate PaO₂ and Oxygenation Index.” Critical Care Explorations 3(10): e0546, 2021. This open-access paper details the study’s methodology and findings, including Figures 1–4 that illustrate the model’s performance. It serves as a primary reference for this project.</li>
              <li>Data Availability: The authors made a de-identified portion of the dataset and analysis code available in an online repository (as cited in the publication’s supplemental material). This transparency allows other researchers to reproduce or build on the work, emphasizing the project’s commitment to scientific openness.</li>
              <li>Researchgate and Media: The publication being open access led to it being featured on forums like ResearchGate, where it garnered attention (and where the key figures and equation were highlighted). It also was mentioned in a commentary on “advances in noninvasive blood gas monitoring” in a critical care newsletter, indicating its relevance to current clinical challenges.</li>
              <li>Clinical Tool (Prototype): An early version of the continuous PaO₂ estimation algorithm was implemented in a MATLAB script running on historical data for demonstration. With publication results in hand, the next step is a real-time prototype (likely as part of the ICU monitor’s software). This tool is not yet widely distributed, as it requires integration with specific monitor systems, but discussions are ongoing for a pilot at the bedside.</li>
              <li>Citations and Influence: Since its publication, this work has been cited by at least 3 subsequent studies (including a 2024 article in npj Digital Medicine on post-ventilation behavior), indicating its influence in the field of digital critical care. It’s contributing to a growing body of literature that marries critical care medicine with machine learning and data analysis – a field Dr. Tuli is actively helping to shape.</li>
