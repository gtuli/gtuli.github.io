            <h2>BLUF</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>World’s largest global health survey (~30M responses) delivered timely local COVID-19 insights across 114 countries[1].</li>
              <li>Demonstrated social-media survey signals correlate with official COVID data, enabling earlier outbreak detection in regions lacking robust surveillance[2].</li>
              <li>Validated a novel global syndromic surveillance approach using social media surveys to complement traditional monitoring for COVID-19 and future health threats[3].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Uneven COVID-19 data worldwide: Many regions lacked timely case data, hindering global situational awareness[4][5].</li>
              <li>Pandemic information lag: Without uniform data across countries, severity was hard to assess in time, especially in areas with weaker health systems[5][6].</li>
              <li>Participatory solution: A daily global Facebook user survey (UMD-CTIS) launched April 2020 to collect standardized COVID-19 metrics in near real-time, regardless of local reporting capacity[7][8].</li>
              <li>Prior successes: Earlier digital surveys (flu, etc.) showed that self-reported symptoms can track disease trends quickly, informing the decision to deploy this global COVID survey[9].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Key Questions Addressed</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Can massive social-media surveys provide reliable, real-time indicators of COVID-19 trends that align with official case data?[10][11]</li>
              <li>Which survey-derived metric best signals emerging COVID-19 outbreaks (e.g., does a community COVID-like illness report outperform other symptom indicators)?[10][11]</li>
              <li>Can this approach fill monitoring gaps in regions with limited testing and reporting infrastructure, thereby improving global surveillance equity?[11][12]</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Regional data disparities: Variation in resources/reporting across countries made simultaneous global COVID tracking challenging[4].</li>
              <li>Delayed and incomplete data: Lack of uniform, timely COVID data (especially in places with strained health systems) obscured true impact and slowed targeted responses[5][6].</li>
              <li>Weak early signals: Novel outbreaks with low initial cases often went undetected by conventional surveillance, which struggled with sparse, noisy early indicators.</li>
              <li>Global blind spots: Relying solely on official reports left gaps—many regions were essentially “flying blind” during crucial early pandemic stages due to data lags.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Importance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Unprecedented coverage: ~30 million survey responses across 114 countries enabled an unparalleled global view of the pandemic in near real-time[13].</li>
              <li>Fills data voids: Provided COVID-19 trend data in locales with scarce testing/reporting, ensuring no region is left without insight[11][14].</li>
              <li>Faster response: Early warnings from survey signals (ahead of official data) can prompt quicker public health actions, potentially saving lives[9].</li>
              <li>Augments public health systems: Complements traditional surveillance by adding a scalable, low-cost global “social sensing” tool for current and future health threats[15].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Global daily survey: Implemented the UMD-CTIS, which randomly invites Facebook users worldwide each day to self-report COVID-related symptoms and status[8].</li>
              <li>Standardized &amp; weighted data: Responses (~100K/day) were weighted for nonresponse and demographics, yielding representative daily metrics for each country[16].</li>
              <li>Machine-learning validation: Trained ML models on country-level survey data confirmed known symptom signals and helped identify the most predictive survey question for outbreaks[17][10].</li>
              <li>Key question focus: Discovered that a single question – community COVID-like illness (CLI) reports – was highly correlated with case trends, simplifying monitoring to one powerful indicator[11].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Data ingestion pipeline: Daily survey data (tens of thousands of responses) flowed into a centralized analysis platform, with automated weighting and cleaning for real-time processing[16].</li>
              <li>Analytic engine: A multi-country time-series analysis, enhanced by ML algorithms (e.g., gradient boosting), turned survey signals into outbreak trend estimates and anomaly flags[10].</li>
              <li>Benchmarking module: Survey-derived CLI rates were continuously correlated with official COVID case data to validate accuracy and calibrate the system[10][11].</li>
              <li>Scalable cloud infrastructure: Built on cloud resources to handle large-scale data and deliver updated global dashboards daily, enabling health officials to access fresh insights anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Results and Impacts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Consistent representativeness: Survey respondent demographics remained stable over time and aligned well with population benchmarks for many countries[16][17].</li>
              <li>Symptom signal confirmed: Self-reported COVID-like illness (CLI) from the survey tracked closely with government case data, verifying that participatory data can reflect true disease trends[10][11].</li>
              <li>Top indicator identified: The community CLI question emerged as the strongest single predictor of COVID case movements, proving especially useful in areas with limited official data[11].</li>
              <li>Global early warning: The system successfully demonstrated that digital surveys can detect and follow pandemic trajectories worldwide, providing earlier alerts in some instances than traditional systems[12].</li>
              <li>Generalizable model: This project established a framework for using social-media-based health surveillance, which has since informed monitoring of other public health threats and proved the value of participatory epidemiology[15].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Skills and Tools Used</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Big Data &amp; ML: Processed 31M+ survey responses and built LightGBM machine-learning models to predict COVID-19 case trends across countries in real time[18].</li>
              <li>Global collaboration: Co-led a worldwide COVID-19 surveillance effort with academia (UMD, CMU) and industry (Facebook/Meta), coordinating data collection and analysis across 114 countries[19].</li>
              <li>Survey analytics: Applied advanced survey statistics (weighting, bias adjustment) and data science techniques to ensure the massive dataset produced valid, actionable insights.</li>
              <li>Cloud pipelines: Deployed an AWS-based pipeline (Python, R) for continuous data ingestion, cleaning, and analysis, enabling daily updates and scalability to millions of records.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Cross-project Capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Real-time data fusion: Mastered integrating and analyzing multi-country, multi-million record datasets in real time – a skill later applied to other large-scale health data projects (e.g., global vaccine studies)[20].</li>
              <li>AI for Public Health: Strengthened expertise in applying AI and data science to epidemiology, a theme across projects (this global survey work set the stage for subsequent vaccine hesitancy and effectiveness studies)[21].</li>
              <li>Public-private partnership: Experience working with a major tech platform (Facebook) to achieve public health goals created a blueprint for future collaborations (like the Google federated study)[20].</li>
              <li>Scalable surveillance design: The approach of building flexible, extensible monitoring pipelines (from data collection to dashboard) was replicated in later projects tackling different health challenges.</li>
