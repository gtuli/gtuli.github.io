<ul>
<li>
         Developed a streaming analytics pipeline for real-time detection of covert malware communications hidden in DNS traffic.
        </li>
<li>
         Identified both fast and stealthy “low-and-slow” malicious DNS patterns that evaded traditional batch detection.
        </li>
<li>
         Enabled immediate security alerts from DNS logs, greatly improving response time to early-stage breaches.

<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Attackers can hide command-and-control signals in ordinary DNS queries, bypassing standard network defenses.
        </li>
<li>
         Organizations face huge volumes of DNS data, and manual monitoring can’t catch subtle malicious patterns.
        </li>
<li>
         Stealthy DNS “tunnels” blend into normal traffic, often escaping detection until significant damage is done.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Built a microservice pipeline to continuously ingest and enrich DNS logs (e.g., adding GeoIP and WHOIS context) for live analysis.
        </li>
<li>
         Implemented multi-scale anomaly detection: short-window analytics to flag immediate threats and long-window analytics to uncover slow, stealthy DNS tunnels.
        </li>
<li>
         Integrated threat intelligence feeds to flag known malicious domains and deployed a real-time alerting dashboard for security teams.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Modular Microservices: Independent services handled data ingestion, threat intel updates, anomaly detection, analytics, alerting, and the user interface.
        </li>
<li>
         Streaming Pipeline: A Kafka message broker streamed DNS events between services, enabling scalable, real-time processing of log data.
        </li>
<li>
         Tiered Storage: Combined in-memory caching for instant analysis with a persistent datastore for historical pattern detection over longer windows.
        </li>
<li>
         Tiered Deployment: Services were grouped by function (data ingestion, analysis, storage, presentation) to optimize performance and scalability.
        </li>
<li>
         Resilient Design: The microservice architecture allowed isolated scaling and updates, ensuring robust, fault-tolerant operation of the system.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Achieved near-instant alerts for emerging DNS-based threats, vastly reducing attacker “dwell time” in networks.
        </li>
<li>
         Improved detection accuracy by combining real-time anomaly flags with historical context and threat intelligence (catching both abrupt spikes and subtle slow attacks).
        </li>
<li>
         Delivered actionable dashboards and alerts that empower security teams to swiftly contain incidents and share new threat indicators with the broader community.
        </li>
