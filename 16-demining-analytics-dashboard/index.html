<h2>
        At a Glance
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Created a geospatial analytics platform that fuses data from multiple landmine detection sensors into a unified risk heatmap.
        </li>
<li>
         The interactive dashboard highlights likely landmine hotspots, enabling demining teams to prioritize and track clearance operations more effectively.
        </li>
<li>
         Designed a modular system architecture allowing new algorithms or sensors to be added without disrupting the whole platform.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Fragmented data: Each landmine detection sensor (e.g., metal detectors, ground-penetrating radar, drones) produced separate data, making it hard to see the overall mine risk landscape.
        </li>
<li>
         High false positives from sensors wasted teams’ time on non-threats, underscoring the need for smarter data analysis to filter out “noise.”
        </li>
<li>
         No real-time geospatial tool existed to help mission planners decide which suspected mine areas to clear first, leading to less efficient use of limited resources.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Architected a five-layer microservice system to ingest various sensor data streams, analyze and fuse them, and present the results in a cohesive way.
        </li>
<li>
         Continuously generated an updated probability heatmap highlighting likely mine locations (“hot zones”), serving as the core decision-support visual for teams.
        </li>
<li>
         Incorporated field feedback (reports of found or cleared mines) back into the model, so the system learns over time and improves its predictive accuracy.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Layered Microservices: Separate services handled data ingestion from each sensor type, data fusion and analysis, risk modeling, user feedback integration, and the user interface.
        </li>
<li>
         Heatmap Generator: The analysis engine produced a geospatial probability heatmap of landmine presence, updating in near real time as new sensor readings and field reports came in.
        </li>
<li>
         Interactive Map UI: A front-end map dashboard allowed users to explore high-risk areas, see details on each zone (e.g., sensor readings, last sweep date), and view progress over time as areas are cleared.
        </li>
<li>
         Feedback Loop: A dedicated module took input from demining teams (confirmed mine finds or cleared areas) and fed that data back into the risk models, continuously refining the system’s predictions.
        </li>
<li>
         Planning Module: An operations planning service combined the latest risk map with external data (terrain, accessibility, team locations) to suggest which suspected areas to address next for optimal safety and efficiency.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Delivered a complete system design for a next-generation demining decision-support tool, demonstrating how modern data integration can improve mine clearance strategy.
        </li>
<li>
         Stakeholders in humanitarian demining reviewed the prototype positively, and plans were initiated to pilot the dashboard in a real demining field operation.
        </li>
<li>
         Highlighted how advanced analytics and AI can significantly enhance safety and efficiency in post-conflict demining, influencing organizations to invest in smarter demining technologies.

        Cross-Project Capabilities
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Modular Architecture: The five-layer microservice approach exemplifies a scalable design pattern Dr. Tuli applies in various domains (from healthcare dashboards to security analytics).
        </li>
<li>
         Real-Time Geospatial Analysis: Skills in creating live risk maps here transfer to other projects involving spatial data (e.g., epidemic spread mapping, environmental monitoring).
        </li>
<li>
         Continuous Improvement Loop: Experience building feedback loops (learning from new field data) is leveraged in other ML systems to ensure they adapt and remain accurate over time.
