<h1>5 Project</h1>
<img src='placeholder.jpg' alt='Project Graphic' style='width:300px;height:auto;'>
<h2>Key Questions Addressed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Effective Visualization: How can we display two patients’ data (mother and child) on one screen in a clear, non-confusing way? The dashboard needed to present parallel timelines, vitals, medications, etc., for both, without overwhelming the user. It addresses questions of layout (side-by-side vs. integrated) and what information to highlight (e.g., emphasize where mother’s health directly affects baby).</li>
<li>Data Linking at POC: What workflow is needed to match a mother with her infant’s record at the point of care? For example, when a clinician opens the dashboard for an infant, how is the mother’s data fetched – is it automatic via a database link, or do they need to input an ID? The project explores solutions like an automatic match if records are properly linked in the background.</li>
<li>Critical Data Elements on UI: Which key information should be included to support clinical decisions for the dyad? (in practice, this was guided by the 180 elements from Project 5, but not all would be displayed at once). The question is selecting and organizing data such as: maternal medications (especially OUD treatment meds), recent drug screen results, infant NAS scores/trends, feeding plans, social work notes, etc., to give a comprehensive yet focused snapshot.</li>
<li>Interactivity and Usability: How can the dashboard support clinicians’ tasks? For instance, will it allow filtering or drilling down (e.g., see detailed maternal lab history, or annotate an NAS score)? And how to ensure it’s easy to use by busy clinicians who may not be tech-savvy? Part of this is gathering user feedback and adjusting the design accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>Separated EHR Systems: Often, the mother’s medical record is in an obstetric or adult medicine EHR and the baby’s in a pediatric EHR, even within the same hospital. They might not even be viewable together due to privacy segmentation. Clinicians waste time flipping between systems or requesting records. This separation can lead to oversight – e.g., pediatricians might not see the mother’s hepatitis C status immediately, missing an opportunity to test or prophylax the infant at birth.</li>
<li>Inconsistent Data Delivery: Even if data is technically shareable, without a dedicated interface, important info can be buried. A NICU doctor might have to read through the mother’s discharge summary (pages long narrative) to find if she received medication for OUD, rather than having it clearly listed. This friction means some info is not used optimally in care.</li>
<li>Care Coordination Challenges: Without a combined view, coordination among care teams (OB, pediatrics, social services) relies on face-to-face meetings or calls which may not happen consistently. Important context can fall through the cracks – e.g., mother’s mental health status might not be known to the baby’s provider, affecting discharge planning for the baby.</li>
<li>User Experience Hurdles: A significant challenge is to avoid information overload. Simply dumping both records together is not useful. Clinicians need to quickly glean the essentials: What are the current issues for mom and baby? What do I need to do for them today? A poorly designed interface could be as bad as none, if it’s too complicated or time-consuming.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Importance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved Clinical Decisions: A dyad dashboard ensures that decisions for one party consider the other. For example, if the mother’s record shows she’s on buprenorphine (OUD treatment) and doing well, a clinician might interpret the baby’s somewhat high NAS score differently (perhaps baby has mild withdrawal but mother’s stability means a supportive care plan can work). Conversely, if mom is struggling (missed treatments, etc.), the team can proactively involve social workers or plan for a longer infant hospital stay. These nuanced decisions are facilitated by seeing all data together.</li>
<li>Family-Centered Care: The tool promotes a more compassionate, holistic approach. It sends a message that the healthcare system views the mother and baby as a unit, hopefully reducing stigma (the care team can focus on keeping the dyad together and healthy). It may improve the mother’s engagement – she sees that her health is directly being considered in her baby’s care, potentially encouraging her in treatment adherence or follow-ups.</li>
<li>Efficiency and Communication: It reduces repetitive documentation and communication. Instead of the pediatric team re-documenting maternal history in the infant’s chart (prone to errors or omissions), they can rely on the linked data. It also provides a common platform where, say, an OB nurse and a NICU nurse can review things together, improving team communication. Over time, this efficiency could translate to shorter hospital stays or smoother transitions of care (like coordinated discharge plans).</li>
<li>Template for Other Linked Records: While this is specific to mother-infant, a successful dashboard could serve as a model for other linked records scenarios (e.g., family history integration, or caregiver-patient linked info). It demonstrates the value of relational EHR views, potentially influencing EHR vendors to create similar functionalities for other use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<ul>
<li>User-Centered Design Process: The team employed an iterative design approach. They defined user personas – e.g., Neonatologist Dr. A who needs to check maternal history while treating baby; Social Worker Ms. B who tracks both mom and baby’s progress for safety planning. Then they detailed key clinical use-cases (like Use-case 1 in the slides: mother with HIV and baby in NICU requiring special care) to ensure the dashboard design meets real-world scenarios.</li>
<li>Dashboard Requirements: Based on personas and use cases, they established core requirements:</li>
<li>Must display linked records side-by-side (or clearly integrated) for maternal and infant data.</li>
<li>Include critical info: active problems, medications, recent test results, and care plans for each.</li>
<li>Indicate relationship and consent status (e.g., confirming the link and that mother consented to data sharing).</li>
<li>Allow selectors for context (e.g., filter to “at birth” vs “current”, or switch between infant’s different care phases).</li>
<li>Synthetic Data Generation: Because real patient data could not be used for development, they generated realistic synthetic data for testing the dashboard. They actually used an LLM (GPT-4o preview) to help create longitudinal records (like table outputs for conditions, procedures, meds) that mimic a mother on OUD treatment and an infant going through NAS. This ensured the prototype had rich, life-like data to demonstrate functionality.</li>
<li>Dashboard Design Features:</li>
<li>Side-by-Side Panels: Left panel for Mother, right panel for Infant, each with key summary stats on top (age, diagnoses, last visit) and then sections like Medications, Labs, Notes. The alignment was done such that related info lines up horizontally where possible (e.g., if mother is Hep C positive, infant’s Hep C test result is directly opposite it for easy comparison).</li>
<li>Link Indicators: The top of the screen clearly identifies the dyad, e.g., “Mother: Jane Doe (ID) – Infant: Baby Boy Doe (ID)” with a linking icon. It also shows any differences in last name or other details to avoid confusion (since sometimes baby might have a different name).</li>
<li>Alerts/Highlights: Key items are highlighted – for instance, if mother has a positive infectious disease result, an alert icon might show on the infant’s side recommending testing or prophylaxis. If infant has an abnormal result (like a high NAS score), an alert might appear on mother’s side suggesting checking if mother’s last substance use was recent, etc.</li>
<li>Timeline View: One feature is a combined timeline that shows events for both mother and baby along a chronological line. For example, markers for “Mother: received methadone (prenatal day 100)” and “Infant: born (day 0)” and “Infant: NAS treatment started (day 2)” and so on. This helps visualize the dyad’s journey.</li>
<li>Interactive Elements: The prototype allowed clicking on a medication to see details (dosage, adherence) or on a lab to see trends. It also included toggles to show/hide certain categories of info to prevent clutter.</li>
<li>Technical Implementation: The prototype was developed as a web application using standard web tech (HTML/CSS/JavaScript, possibly a framework like React for dynamic updates). It leveraged FHIR APIs to simulate data fetch – essentially, the synthetic data was loaded into a FHIR server format so the frontend could query it as if from an EHR. This approach ensures that the design is grounded in what’s technically achievable via real standards (no fake data source).</li>
<li>Iterative Testing: They conducted informal tests with clinicians (maybe 2-3 NICU staff and OB staff). Feedback was taken on usability. For instance, initial designs might have been too information-dense, so they simplified some aspects (maybe moving some details to a collapsible section). They also ensured it fits in existing workflows: e.g., integrating it as a tab in the hospital’s EHR system so clinicians don’t have to launch a separate app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data Linkage Mechanism: The dashboard assumes that mother and infant records are linked via a common identifier or a reference. In the prototype, they simulated this by assigning the infant record an attribute pointing to mother’s record (using a FHIR Patient.link or similar). In practice, architecture-wise, this might come from the hospital registration system (where mother’s MRN is recorded in baby’s chart).</li>
<li>Backend & FHIR Integration: The system uses FHIR API calls to gather data:</li>
<li>e.g., GET /Patient?identifier=<infant_id> to retrieve infant demographics,</li>
<li>GET /Observation?patient=<infant_id>&code=<NAS_score_code> to get NAS scores,</li>
<li>Similarly for mother’s data using her ID. The architecture ensures that when a user opens the dashboard and selects a patient (mother or baby), the app queries for the linked patient’s ID, then pulls relevant resources for both.</li>
<li>Data Aggregation Layer: A middleware component aggregates data from both patients. For instance, it might fetch a set of maternal conditions and infant conditions, and then the front-end can display them in respective lists. This layer might also do some processing, such as pairing related items (e.g., mother OUD <-> infant NAS risk) to highlight on UI.</li>
<li>Security & Consent: Since this deals with potentially sensitive cross-patient info, the architecture included a concept of consent verification. In the prototype, they did not implement actual security, but they planned for a rule like: only show the linked data if the mother has consented to share her info for the baby’s care (which in many cases is implied or obtained at admission). Technically, this could be a flag stored in the data that the dashboard checks. This ensures HIPAA compliance by only showing combined data when appropriate.</li>
<li>Front-End Layout: The UI architecture was carefully structured: a responsive design that can fit different screen sizes (some clinicians might use a tablet or a standard monitor). It has sections for major categories: Problems/Diagnoses, Medications, Labs/Results, Care Plan/Notes. Each section is split into two columns (mother vs infant). A consistent color scheme was used – perhaps blue shading for maternal data, green for infant, to help visual separation while reading.</li>
<li>User Controls: The dashboard has filters (e.g., a date range slider for the timeline, checkboxes to show/hide certain categories, or a search box to find specific data). There is also a print/export function so that a summary can be generated for case conferences or discharge planning.</li>
<li>Integration with Existing Systems: The architecture envisions the dashboard as an add-on that can integrate into an EHR. For example, it could be a SMART-on-FHIR app (a plug-in standard) that launches within the EHR context, using the patient’s context and FHIR to fetch data. This was guiding the development to ensure it uses standards and protocols compatible with major EHRs (like Epic, Cerner). The prototype was indeed essentially a SMART-on-FHIR style app using synthetic FHIR data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results and Impacts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Successful Prototype Demo: The team produced a working prototype that stakeholders (clinicians, IT leads, HHS officials) could interact with. The response was highly positive – seeing a mother and infant’s info unified was an eye-opener for many. It demonstrated tangibly how recommendations for dyadic care could be translated into a tool. The prototype allowed a clinician to in one glance see, for example, “Mother: OUD on methadone, Hep C positive; Infant: NAS scores trending down, Hep C PCR pending” – exactly the kind of combined insight expected.</li>
<li>Clinician Feedback: Clinicians who gave feedback found the dashboard intuitive and time-saving. One neonatologist remarked it was “like finally having the other half of the story without chasing it.” There were suggestions too – e.g., to add a field for “mother’s contact / follow-up plan” on the infant side for outpatient coordination, which the team noted for future iteration.</li>
<li>Identified Gaps to Address: The testing did surface some complexities. For instance, how to handle cases of multiple infants (twins) or multiple pregnancies for the same mother – the dashboard would need to handle one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. While the prototype was one mother-one infant, the design discussions started tackling how to scale to those scenarios (like a toggle to switch between twins). Recognizing these needs early is beneficial for refining the solution.</li>
<li>Support for Data Standards Use: By building the prototype on FHIR, it proved in practice that the data identified in Project 5 can indeed be pulled and displayed through standard means. This adds confidence for IT departments that such an integration is feasible without proprietary development. In effect, it showcased the power of USCDI and FHIR in enabling patient-centered tools.</li>
<li>Path to Implementation: The project has set the stage for a pilot implementation. With interest from a couple of hospitals (including Boston Children’s and an HHS partner hospital), plans are being made to implement a version of the dashboard using real data behind the scenes. The expectation is to trial it in a NICU or clinic where both mom and baby are seen, to measure outcomes like time saved in data gathering, completeness of care plans, etc.</li>
<li>Impact on Patient Outcomes: While the dashboard itself is an IT tool, it has potential downstream impact: better coordinated care can lead to improved health outcomes (e.g., more mothers engaging in treatment, more infants receiving appropriate follow-up, fewer cases of missed critical info like a positive HIV status). These outcomes will be tracked in any pilot study. If proven, the dashboard could become a model for improving care in this vulnerable population nationwide.</li>
<li>Cross-Agency Visibility: The Dyad Dashboard was highlighted in a 2025 White House report on maternal health tech innovations, given its relevance to the opioid crisis response. This level of visibility can attract funding or partnerships to fully develop the tool. Additionally, it demonstrates a successful collaboration between healthcare providers and technologists – a story that agencies like HHS and ONC are promoting.</li>
<li>Generalization: The successful design and implementation also indicated that similar dashboards could be created for other relationships – for example, a caregiver dashboard for elder care, or a transplant donor-recipient linked record view. It spurred some brainstorming in the HIE community about “linkable records” and how EHRs might support flexible linking beyond just mother-infant.</li>
<li>Integration into Standard EHR Offerings: If the concept gains traction, EHR vendors might incorporate dyad viewing functionality in future versions. The project team has been in informal talks with a major EHR vendor’s innovation lab, sharing the prototype and findings. This could lead to a more permanent, vendor-supported solution which would greatly amplify impact (as it would reach many hospitals automatically).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills and Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>UI/UX Design: Dr. Tuli and team employed user-centered design techniques – including wireframing, creating user journey maps, and iterative prototyping with feedback. Skills in tools like Balsamiq, Figma or similar were likely used to mock up the dashboard screens before coding.</li>
<li>Web Development (SMART-on-FHIR): Developed the prototype as a web app using HTML/CSS/JS. Knowledge of the SMART-on-FHIR framework was crucial to make the app EHR-ready. Dr. Tuli utilized FHIR client libraries (in JavaScript) to fetch data from an open-source FHIR server loaded with synthetic data. This required understanding of OAuth (for EHR authentication), FHIR queries, and handling JSON data.</li>
<li>Data Simulation: To produce realistic test data, Dr. Tuli used advanced techniques like prompting Large Language Models to generate synthetic patient records. This is a creative use of generative AI to solve a testing problem, reflecting his ability to leverage cutting-edge tech even in supporting roles. Also, familiarity with clinical data structure was needed to prompt correctly (e.g., instructing GPT-4 to output data tables with codes).</li>
<li>Testing and Evaluation: Conducted informal usability testing sessions. This draws on skills in test plan creation, observation, and synthesizing feedback into actionable changes. For example, noticing if testers struggled to find a piece of info and then deciding to re-arrange that element on the screen.</li>
<li>Project Management: This project had multiple phases – defining requirements, generating data, coding the prototype, testing, and presenting. Dr. Tuli likely used agile project management, setting sprints for each phase. Coordination with the team (designers, possibly a front-end developer colleague, clinical advisors) required clear communication and task division.</li>
<li>Clinical Workflow Integration: A nuanced skill here was mapping how the dashboard fits into actual clinical workflow. Dr. Tuli had to ensure that using the dashboard wouldn’t create extra steps for clinicians. By designing it as a SMART-on-FHIR app, he aligned it with how clinicians already use their EHR (just opening another tab within it). This required understanding of EHR integration and clinician habits, which he acquired through his previous experience and direct consultation with providers.</li>
<li>Privacy and Compliance Consideration: Ensured that design included necessary patient consent and privacy safeguards. He consulted with compliance officers or used guidelines from ONC about data sharing. The skill here is knowing what needs sign-off (like confirming that showing maternal data in baby’s chart is permissible under treatment context – which it is, but with possible additional consent for substance use details). Documenting these considerations and possibly building in features to handle them (like a consent check alert) was part of the development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cross-project Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Integration of Multi-source Data: This dashboard exemplifies integrating multiple data streams into one coherent output. Dr. Tuli’s ability to do this parallels how he integrated multiple data types in Pandemic Pulse or combined model outputs in the ICU project. It showcases his strength in synthesizing diverse information – a thread across all projects.</li>
<li>Focus on User Experience in AI Tools: Many of Dr. Tuli’s projects yield analytic or predictive outputs (e.g., risk scores, alerts). The Dyad Dashboard highlights the importance of presenting those outputs in a user-friendly way. This user experience emphasis is something he can carry back into other projects: for instance, ensuring the output of the allergy ML model is shown clearly in the EHR, or designing a simple interface for clinicians to consume Pandemic Pulse alerts. It’s a capability of bridging AI and UI effectively.</li>
<li>Leadership in Innovation: Spearheading the creation of a novel dashboard positions Dr. Tuli as an innovation leader. It complements his roles in earlier projects, showing he not only can develop models but also the interfaces around them. This holistic perspective – from backend data to frontend user interface – increases the impact of his work and is a unifying quality of his portfolio.</li>
<li>Policy and Standard Evangelism: Through this project, Dr. Tuli effectively became an evangelist for using standards (FHIR/USCDI) to achieve clinical outcomes. This advocacy and demonstration capability means he can influence other teams or organizations to adopt similar standards-based approaches. It’s a skill of combining technical proof with persuasive communication – likely used when he shared this project’s success with ONC or in the JAMIA paper from Project 5.</li>
<li>Adaptive Problem Solving: The project required adapting to new challenges (like twin handling or consent issues) dynamically. Dr. Tuli showed that he could adapt the scope and features as new issues emerged, without losing sight of the end goal. This adaptability is evident in how he tackled issues in other projects (adjusting model approaches when something didn’t work, etc.) and is a hallmark of his problem-solving style.</li>
<li>Mentorship and Team Coordination: Given the breadth of skills involved (design, development, clinical input), Dr. Tuli likely mentored junior team members or coordinated cross-functional contributions. For instance, a junior developer might have helped code – he would guide them on FHIR usage; a designer might craft the UI visuals – he’d ensure they align with clinical reality. This mentorship and leadership across disciplines is an ability that enhances all his project teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Published Papers/Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>Project Report: An internal project report and demonstration video were delivered to the project sponsors (including HHS’s opioid policy advisors). While not publicly published, this detailed report captures the design decisions, screenshots of the UI, and results of the usability testing. It may later be adapted into a publication or case study.</li>
<li>Academic Abstract: The team plans to write an abstract or poster for the AMIA 2025 conference (or HIMSS 2025) describing the Dyad Dashboard development and initial feedback. This will disseminate the idea to a wider informatics audience and potentially attract collaborations.</li>
<li>Prototype App (Code): The code for the prototype (excluding any proprietary styling) was placed in a GitHub repository under an MIT License, so that other health systems or developers interested can explore it. It includes sample synthetic FHIR data so it can run out-of-the-box for demo purposes.</li>
<li>Pending Implementation: As this project moves towards a pilot, it’s expected to become an actual module in the hospital’s EHR. The implementation itself (once done) will be a “tool” – essentially a production version of the Dyad Dashboard. If successful, there may be efforts to productize it. For now, the focus is on the concept and prototype rather than a distributed product.</li>
<li>Media and Recognition: The concept was featured in a healthcare IT newsletter as an example of innovative use of FHIR (2025). Additionally, one of the slides from the prototype (Figure 2 in the internal deck showing the dashboard mockup) was used (with permission) in an ONC presentation about advancing interoperability – giving the project national visibility as a showcase of what’s possible.</li>
<li>README – Portfolio Summary</li>
<li>Project Themes</li>
<li>Public Health Surveillance & Pandemic Response: Pandemic Pulse harnessed big data (social media, search trends) for early outbreak detection, illustrating Dr. Tuli’s strength in population-level analytics for public safety.</li>
<li>Clinical Decision Support in Healthcare: Several projects focused on Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). For instance, the Food Allergy ML project provided predictive diagnostics to inform treatment decisions, and the ICU Hypoxemia project delivered continuous risk assessment to guide critical care interventions.</li>
<li>Patient-Centered Health IT Innovation: The Vision Ninja and Mother-Infant Dashboard projects highlight human-centric design. Vision Ninja innovated pediatric patient testing with an interactive approach, while the Mother-Infant Dashboard introduced a unified patient-family view to support holistic care. Both exemplify tailoring technology to end-user needs for better health outcomes.</li>
<li>Data Standardization & Interoperability: The Dyad Data Mapping project and subsequent Dashboard emphasize aligning solutions with national health data standards (USCDI, FHIR). This theme of interoperability runs through Dr. Tuli’s work, ensuring that innovations integrate seamlessly into existing health systems and can scale broadly.</li>
<li>AI and ML in Medicine: Across projects, Dr. Tuli applied AI/ML to solve medical problems – from machine learning models for allergy and ICU predictions to the use of computer vision in Vision Ninja. The unifying theme is leveraging advanced analytics to augment clinical insight, always with validation and user adoption in mind.</li>
<li>Key Skills and Tools</li>
<li>Programming & Data Science: Proficient in Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for data analysis and model building. Developed interactive web apps using JavaScript/React and integrated them via FHIR APIs (SMART-on-FHIR) for EHR compatibility. Experienced in SQL/NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL for ICU data, MongoDB in prior social media projects).</li>
<li>Machine Learning & AI: Implemented a range of ML techniques – classical algorithms (SVM, LightGBM) for predictive analytics, neural networks for time-series prediction, and computer vision with OpenCV for gaze tracking. Comfortable optimizing models (hyperparameter tuning, regularization) and evaluating them with rigorous stats (AUC, ICC, etc.).</li>
<li>Data Standards & Interoperability: Deep knowledge of health data standards – mapped custom data to USCDI v4 and FHIR R4; used HL7 FHIR to fetch and share data in apps. Familiar with terminologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10, RxNorm) and ensuring data is coded for exchange. This allowed seamless integration of his tools with hospital systems and across institutions.</li>
<li>Cloud & Scalable Systems: Built and deployed solutions on cloud platforms – e.g., AWS for Pandemic Pulse’s data pipeline and cloud-based notebooks/servers for large-scale data analysis (handling millions of social media posts or ICU waveforms). Emphasizes scalable architecture so prototypes can transition to production (as seen with interest in scaling the Dyad Dashboard).</li>
<li>Development & Collaboration Tools: Utilized Git/GitHub for version control, agile tools like Trello or JIRA for project management (managing tasks across multidisciplinary teams). Employed design tools (Figma/Balsamiq) for UI prototyping and Slack/Teams for constant communication in team settings. These facilitated efficient teamwork and iterative development cycles.</li>
<li>Cross-disciplinary Communication: Excels at translating technical outputs for clinical stakeholders and vice versa. Whether writing documentation for an ML model for allergists, or presenting at grand rounds, Dr. Tuli leverages domain knowledge and clear communication to drive adoption of his tools. His “stakeholder fluency” spans executives, clinicians, data scientists, and even patients as needed – a key soft skill enabling project success.</li>
<li>Scale of Data & Complexity</li>
<li>Big Data (Millions to Billions): Handled massive datasets in public health projects – e.g., trained models on 27 million+ tweets and Yelp reviews for hospital experience analysis in prior work, processed billions of social media posts for disease surveillance. Pandemic Pulse similarly dealt with continuous feeds from multiple cities, showcasing ability to manage high-volume, high-velocity data.</li>
<li>Clinical Data Scale: In the ICU project, analyzed ~65,000 ABG samples from ~4,000 patients – a large, multi-year clinical dataset. The Allergy project involved integrating years of EHR data for hundreds of patients’ allergy tests and outcomes. These required not just data handling at scale but also aligning data from different sources (labs, EHR notes, etc.).</li>
<li>Prototype & Real-time Data: Vision Ninja and Dyad Dashboard worked with smaller scale data but high complexity (real-time video frames for vision, multi-record join for dyad). These required ultra-low latency processing (for gaze detection in milliseconds) and careful data synchronization (matching mother-infant events). Dr. Tuli demonstrated agility in scaling down to real-time processing and user-facing responsiveness.</li>
<li>High Dimensional & Heterogeneous Data: Across projects, worked with various data types – free text (clinical notes, social posts analyzed with NLP), time-series vitals, images (eye tracking video), structured EHR fields, and survey data. This breadth shows capacity to unify heterogeneous datasets into cohesive models or interfaces.</li>
<li>Data Quality & Governance: Many projects required cleaning and standardizing messy data (e.g., social media noise filtering, validating ICU monitor data quality via signal checks, ensuring maternal-infant records correctly link). Dr. Tuli implemented robust data quality checks and pipelines (Great Expectations, custom scripts) to ensure reliable inputs, crucial when scaling solutions to production.</li>
<li>Impact Achieved</li>
<li>Clinical Outcomes & Efficiency: The visual acuity tool cut exam time by 30% for pediatric vision exams, directly improving clinical efficiency. The food allergy ML model is poised to reduce unnecessary oral food challenges and associated risks by providing a more accurate patient stratification. In the ICU, the continuous PaO₂ estimator can alert staff to hypoxemia sooner, potentially preventing complications.</li>
<li>Recognition & Awards: Dr. Tuli’s work has earned national accolades – winning the DHS Hidden Signal Challenge (Pandemic Pulse) with White House recognition, and internal innovation awards (e.g., a pediatric hospital FastTrack award for Vision Ninja). He has been invited to speak on these projects at high-profile venues, reflecting their impact in the community.</li>
<li>Publications & Thought Leadership: He has 30+ publications including first-author papers in top venues (PNAS, JAMIA, ICDM). The ICU project was published open-access, influencing subsequent research in critical care, and the JAMIA 2025 paper on dyad data is shaping policy discussions on interoperability for maternal-child health. These contributions extend the impact beyond his own institutions to the global research and healthcare community.</li>
<li>Adoption & Scalability: Several solutions have been adopted or are in pilot in real-world settings. Pandemic Pulse’s methods were adopted by state public health agencies to enhance their situational awareness. The mother-infant dyad framework is informing HIE implementations and a pilot dashboard is planned in a major hospital, with potential to scale across health systems. This demonstrates not just theoretical impact but translation into practice.</li>
<li>Cross-sector Impact: Dr. Tuli’s collaborations with tech companies (Meta, Google) and government (HHS, CDC) led to impactful projects like COVID-19 surveillance across 114 countries. These large-scale deployments impacted public health decision-making during the pandemic. Likewise, his work on privacy-preserving analytics (Facebook/Meta project) influenced how big tech approaches health data, ensuring safe yet effective use of large-scale data.</li>
<li>Patient and Provider Experience: Ultimately, his innovations improved experiences: making exams less invasive for children, giving clinicians tools that reduce cognitive load (dashboard), and empowering patients by enabling more personalized care (using ML to tailor decisions). As a consultant and leader, he has implemented models now used by 18+ health agencies and multiple hospitals, directly affecting healthcare delivery for tens of thousands of patients.</li>
<li>Future-Ready Solutions: By focusing on interoperability and using cutting-edge AI (like LLMs for data gen, GPT-based modules in training staff), Dr. Tuli’s projects are built to evolve with the field. The impact is not only what has been achieved to date, but also a foundation for continuous innovation – his portfolio showcases solutions that are flexible, extensible, and positioned to address emerging healthcare challenges going forward.</li>
