                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Separate maternal and infant EHR systems prevent clinicians
                    from seeing the full dyad picture when treating
                    substance-exposed families.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Critical dyad-specific details—maternal treatment plans,
                    infant NAS scores, social services involvement—lack
                    consistent standardized fields.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Privacy regulations and lagging claims data slow information
                    exchange, leaving care teams without timely, shareable
                    context.

                    Catalogued 180 clinical and social data elements essential
                    to dyad care and mapped each to USCDI and FHIR definitions
                    to quantify coverage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Surveyed HIEs and hospitals to understand current
                    mother–infant linkage practices and adoption of national
                    interoperability standards.

                    Visualized coverage and gaps through Sankey charts and

              <h2>Part B — Maternal-Infant Dyad Care Dashboard Prototype</h2>
              <div class="project-subsection">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Mother and infant records live in different systems, forcing
                    clinicians to toggle across interfaces and risking missed
                    context during fast-moving care decisions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Key maternal information is often buried in long notes,
                    making it difficult to correlate with infant withdrawal
                    trends.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cross-disciplinary teams rely on manual updates, so
                    actionable dyad intelligence rarely reaches the bedside in
                    time.

                <h3>The Solution</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Designed a SMART-on-FHIR application that pulls
                    authenticated data for linked mother–infant pairs into a
                    unified, parallel layout.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Collaborated with OB, NICU, and social work stakeholders to
                    prioritize content and interaction patterns that match dyad
                    workflows.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Populated the prototype with realistic synthetic data to
                    demonstrate core use cases—e.g., comparing maternal
                    toxicology results with infant NAS trajectories.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
                <ul>

                    Iterated low- to high-fidelity designs in Balsamiq and
                    Figma, grounding interface choices in clinician journey
                    mapping.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented the front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Queried FHIR resources—medications, labs, vitals—for both
                    mother and infant, using shared identifiers to pair records
                    in real time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Generated synthetic dyad datasets with GPT-4 and custom
                    scripts to test the interface under realistic clinical
                    scenarios.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ran usability walkthroughs with clinicians, adjusting layout
                    and highlighting logic based on observation and feedback.

                  <li>
                    Clinicians immediately saw the benefit of seeing maternal
                    context alongside infant NAS scores, validating the design
                    direction.

                    advancing to a pilot, citing the prototype as proof of
