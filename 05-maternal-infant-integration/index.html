         <li>
          Separate maternal and infant EHR systems prevent clinicians from seeing the full dyad picture when treating substance-exposed families.
         </li>
         <li>
          Critical dyad-specific details—maternal treatment plans, infant NAS scores, social services involvement—lack consistent standardized fields.
         </li>
         <li>
          Privacy regulations and lagging claims data slow information exchange, leaving care teams without timely, shareable context.

          Mother and infant records live in different systems, forcing clinicians to toggle across interfaces and risking missed context during fast-moving care decisions.
         </li>
         <li>
          Key maternal information is often buried in long notes, making it difficult to correlate with infant withdrawal trends.
         </li>
         <li>
          Cross-disciplinary teams rely on manual updates, so actionable dyad intelligence rarely reaches the bedside in time.
