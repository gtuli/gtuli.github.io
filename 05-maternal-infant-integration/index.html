        The Problem
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Mother and baby medical records are usually kept separate (often in different systems), making it hard for caregivers to see the full picture for substance-exposed mother–infant pairs.
        </li>
        <li>
         Important information specific to these dyads (e.g., maternal opioid treatment plans, infant withdrawal scores, social services involvement) may not be recorded in standardized fields, hindering data sharing and care coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
         Privacy laws around substance use (like 42 CFR Part 2) and reliance on slow, after-the-fact data (e.g., insurance claims) further complicate timely information exchange, leaving providers “flying blind” when trying to help these vulnerable mothers and babies.

       <h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Conducted a comprehensive crosswalk of critical clinical and social data elements needed for managing substance-exposed mother–infant pairs, mapping each one to fields in national interoperability standards (USCDI and FHIR). This identified which elements are already covered and which are missing.
        </li>
        <li>
         Surveyed Health Information Exchange (HIE) networks and hospitals to assess if and how they currently link mother and infant records, and whether they use available standards to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
         Developed recommendations based on the findings: for instance, suggesting additions to data standards for any gaps (ensuring future versions include fields for things like “maternal opioid treatment status”), and urging adoption of existing standards to support automatic mother-infant record linkage in healthcare systems.

        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Cross-mapping Methodology: Employed a blend of manual expert review and script-assisted search to match 180 specialized data needs to standard data definitions. Used spreadsheets as a catalog and wrote simple Python scripts to query FHIR/USCDI specifications for relevant terms, ensuring nothing was overlooked.
        </li>
        <li>
         HIE Survey &amp; Analysis: Designed a targeted questionnaire (mix of multiple-choice and short answer) for HIE organizations and hospital IT staff, asking about their capability to link mother-baby records and their use of FHIR/USCDI. Analyzed responses qualitatively and quantitatively (using Python for aggregating answers where applicable) to gauge the real-world interoperability landscape.
        </li>
        <li>
         Visualization of Results: Created clear visual summaries of the mapping outcome – for example, a Sankey diagram to illustrate how many of the 180 elements map cleanly to standards versus how many fall outside. These visuals helped communicate where current standards suffice and where gaps lie.
        </li>
        <li>
         Expert Validation: Worked iteratively with clinical experts (neonatologists, OB/GYN, addiction specialists) and informaticians to verify that all crucial data elements were captured and that mappings were semantically correct. This ensured the framework’s accuracy and credibility.
        </li>
        <li>
         Integration Points: Outlined how the findings can be used in practice: e.g., showing that because 91% of needed data has standard fields, a dashboard (like the Maternal-Infant Dyad Care Dashboard project) can reliably pull most data via FHIR APIs today, while highlighting which remaining data might require custom handling or advocacy for standard updates.
        </li>

        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Discovered that an overwhelming majority of required mother-infant data points (over 91%) are already representable within current USCDI and FHIR standards, a very encouraging finding – it means technical barriers to linking these records are relatively low if systems use the standards.
        </li>
        <li>
         Identified the specific gaps (the ~9% of elements not covered) and provided concrete suggestions to standards bodies. This work was published in JAMIA (2025), immediately establishing a knowledge base for others trying to connect maternal and child health data.
        </li>
        <li>
         The findings have directly influenced policy and practice: for example, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) cited this study in a health equity data guidance, using it as an example of crucial data exchange for at-risk populations. Within HHS, the mapped element list became the foundation for a “Dyad Data Tracker” initiative, essentially turning the research into a blueprint for a real system to monitor outcomes for substance-exposed families.

       <ul>
        <li>
         Standards-Based Integration: Mastery of data standards (USCDI, FHIR) obtained here is directly applied in other projects that integrate data (e.g., using FHIR APIs for the dyad dashboard or pulling EHR data for the ICU alert system). Knowing the standards accelerates development and ensures interoperability in his solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
         Policy-Tech Bridging: Demonstrated ability to operate at the intersection of health policy and technical implementation – a rare skill that means he designs solutions (across projects) that not only work technically but also align with and leverage national health IT initiatives, increasing their impact and adoption potential.
        </li>
        <li>
         Thorough Problem Scoping: Showcased a strategic approach of surveying and understanding the broader ecosystem before building a tool. This research-first mindset (seen here in mapping the landscape, similarly in reviewing existing methods before new model development in other projects) ensures that each project addresses the right problem the right way and produces generalizable insights, not just a one-off fix.

         Peer-Reviewed Study: Published in Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA), 2025 – “The substance-exposed birthing person–infant dyad and health information exchange in the United States.” This paper provides the detailed mapping results and is a key reference for improving data sharing in this area.
        </li>
        <li>
         Supplementary Artifact: A comprehensive supplementary spreadsheet listing all 180 data elements and their mapping to standard codes was released with the publication. This deliverable serves as a ready-to-use reference for health IT implementers looking to configure their systems for mother-infant data exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
         Knowledge Dissemination: Findings were presented to the ONC’s interoperability working group in 2024 (timed with USCDI v4 discussions) and at the AMIA 2025 conference, spreading awareness in both policy and informatics communities. The project’s influence is further evidenced by ONC guidance documents and an internal HHS project (Dyad Data Tracker) that have incorporated its recommendations.
