<ul>
<li>
         Analyzed 7,500+ US COVID-19 clinical trials to quantify gender gaps in study leadership.
        </li>
<li>
         Found women made up ~37% of trial principal investigators, rising to ~49% by 2022.
        </li>
<li>
         Highlighted underrepresentation of women vs ~50% in other diseases, prompting equity awareness efforts.

<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Urgent pandemic trials initially favored established male-led networks, limiting women’s opportunities.
        </li>
<li>
         Some research fields had historically fewer women leaders, likely exacerbating COVID-19 leadership gaps.
        </li>
<li>
         Lack of data left the gender imbalance anecdotal, hindering recognition and action to address it.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Compiled a comprehensive dataset of ~8,000 COVID-19 trials (2020–2022) and comparable non-COVID trials.
        </li>
<li>
         Applied an ML-based tool to infer each investigator’s gender from their name with high confidence.
        </li>
<li>
         Analyzed gender proportions over time and versus other diseases, using statistical tests to validate differences.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Automated Data Pipeline: Gathered trial records from ClinicalTrials.gov for COVID-19 and baseline disease areas.
        </li>
<li>
         Gender Inference Module: Used a name-based ML service to probabilistically assign investigator gender.
        </li>
<li>
         Data Filtering: Excluded trials lacking listed investigators or without confident gender classification.
        </li>
<li>
         Analytic Engine: Computed female-leadership percentages by time period and ran cross-disease comparisons.
        </li>
<li>
         Advanced Analysis: Linked leader gender to trial participant gender and segmented outcomes by trial type.
        </li>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Women constituted ~37% of COVID-19 trial leaders overall, climbing to ~49% by 2022.
        </li>
<li>
         Female-led trials tended to enroll more female participants, suggesting leadership influences inclusivity.
        </li>
<li>
         The study spotlighted gender gaps and urged institutions to support women in research leadership roles.
