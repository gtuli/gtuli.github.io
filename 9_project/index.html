            <h2>BLUF</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyzed ~7,500 US COVID-19 clinical trials (2020–2022) using an ML tool to infer investigator gender from names, to quantify gender disparities in trial leadership[67][68].</li>
              <li>Women were ~37% of COVID-19 trial principal investigators, significantly underrepresented compared to similar trials in other diseases (where ~50% of leaders were women)[69].</li>
              <li>Female leadership in COVID-19 trials did improve over time – rising from ~32% in early 2020 to ~49% by early 2022 – but overall remained lower than in fields like HIV or oncology[70].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The pandemic’s career impact: COVID-19 disruptions disproportionately affected women in academia. Early in the pandemic (mid-2020), only ~28% of COVID clinical trials had female PIs and a similar low percentage of women were first authors on COVID papers[71].</li>
              <li>Concern: During urgent public health crises, women might be sidelined in leadership roles (“bench to bedside” research leadership) due to systemic biases or increased personal responsibilities – potentially widening gender gaps[72][73].</li>
              <li>Goal: We set out to systematically track the gender of leaders (PIs, study chairs, directors) for COVID-19 trials throughout the pandemic and compare against baseline disparities in other diseases, to see if COVID exacerbated or mirrored existing gaps[67][74].</li>
              <li>We also examined whether having women as trial leaders was associated with enrolling more female participants, and whether certain trial types (drug, behavioral, etc.) had different gender representation among leaders[75][76].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Key Questions Addressed</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>How did the proportion of women in leadership positions of US COVID-19 trials change from the start of the pandemic in 2020 to later stages in 2022?[70]</li>
              <li>Were women underrepresented as leaders of COVID-19 trials compared to leaders in similar trials for other diseases (e.g., breast cancer, diabetes, HIV)?[69]</li>
              <li>Is there a relationship between the gender of trial leaders and the gender of participants enrolled in those trials (i.e., do female-led trials enroll more female participants)?[76]</li>
              <li>Did female leadership differ by trial intervention type in COVID-19 studies (for instance, were women more involved in behavioral trials vs. drug trials)?[77]</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Pandemic urgency and bias: The rapid mobilization for COVID-19 research may have favored established (often male) networks, potentially limiting women’s opportunities to lead pivotal trials, especially early on[72].</li>
              <li>Structural underrepresentation: Certain medical research fields (e.g., pulmonary/critical care) traditionally have fewer women in senior roles, which could carry over into COVID-19 trials and exacerbate gender disparity in leadership[78].</li>
              <li>Unknown scale of gap: Without data, the extent of gender imbalance in COVID research leadership was largely anecdotal. This uncertainty made it difficult to address or prioritize gender equity during the pandemic.</li>
              <li>Potential impact on research: Lack of diverse leadership can influence trial focus and participant diversity, possibly limiting the generalizability and inclusivity of COVID-19 research outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Importance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Equity in science: Ensuring women are represented in leading research roles is crucial for fairness and brings diverse perspectives that improve scientific problem-solving[79].</li>
              <li>Participant representation: The analysis found that trials led by women tended to enroll more female participants (~13% more, before adjusting), suggesting that diverse leadership could enhance the inclusivity of clinical research[76][80].</li>
              <li>Accountability and awareness: By quantifying the gender gap in COVID-19 trials, this work raises awareness among institutions and funding agencies to take corrective actions (e.g., mentorship, funding opportunities for women) even amid crises[72][81].</li>
              <li>Lessons for future crises: Recognizing that women were initially underrepresented in COVID-19 research leadership underscores the need to consciously include women in leadership when responding to future public health emergencies[79][81].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Data gathering: Compiled a comprehensive list of 8,058 COVID-19-related trials registered in the US from Jan 1, 2020 to Aug 1, 2022 via ClinicalTrials.gov, and similarly gathered trials for four comparison disease areas (breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, other respiratory diseases, HIV) for context[82][74].</li>
              <li>Automated gender inference: Used a validated machine learning tool (<code>genderize.io</code>) to probabilistically infer each investigator’s gender from their first name, including only those names with ≥80% confidence in male vs female classification[67][68].</li>
              <li>Data filtering: Excluded trials with no listed human investigator or where the algorithm couldn’t assign a gender confidently (roughly one-third of trials), resulting in ~7,500 COVID trials with usable data for analysis[68].</li>
              <li>Analysis: Calculated the percentage of women in leadership positions (PI, co-PI, etc.) for COVID-19 trials and for each comparison disease category. Employed Yates’ chi-square tests to compare proportions between COVID and other diseases, and tracked changes over time by splitting COVID trials into time periods (e.g., early 2020 vs early 2022)[83][84].</li>
              <li>Extended analysis: Performed a linear regression to examine if trials with female leaders had higher female participant enrollment. Also analyzed leadership by trial type (drug, behavioral, etc.) to see if certain trial domains had better gender balance than others[85][76].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Data pipeline: Wrote Python scripts to query ClinicalTrials.gov via API and web scraping, pulling trial metadata (start date, disease, locations) and investigator names. This created a database of 11,281 trials (COVID + comparators) to filter and analyze[82][86].</li>
              <li>Gender inference module: Integrated the <code>Genderize.io</code> API/service to assign a likely gender to each investigator name in the dataset, storing confidence scores. Names with low confidence were marked and those trials were set aside to maintain accuracy[68][87].</li>
              <li>Statistical analysis: Used R to conduct chi-square tests for comparing female leadership rates between categories and over time, and linear regression for the participant gender analysis. Also performed non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis) when comparing more than two groups (multiple disease categories)[88][76].</li>
              <li>Visualization: Created charts (e.g., line chart of % trials led by women over time, bar charts comparing disease categories, and a figure illustrating the proportion of women in leadership per quarter) to easily communicate trends. One key figure showed the quarterly increase in female leadership for COVID trials from 2020 to 2022[70][89].</li>
              <li>Validation: Cross-checked a sample of the algorithm’s gender assignments manually and against known datasets to ensure reliability. Also compared the found rates to prior studies (e.g., a 2021 study on COVID trial leadership) to validate that our findings were in plausible ranges[72].</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results and Impacts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Increasing female leadership: As the pandemic progressed, women’s representation in COVID-19 trial leadership rose significantly. In H1 2020, ~32.2% of leadership positions were held by women; by H1 2022 this was ~49.2%, a marked improvement (p&lt;0.001)[70].</li>
              <li>Overall disparity in COVID trials: Cumulatively from 2020–2022, only 37.4% of COVID-19 trial leadership roles (PI or equivalent) were filled by women[69]. This was significantly lower than the proportion in trials for type 2 diabetes (47.6% women leaders), breast cancer (59.9%), and HIV (54.1%)[69]. Non-COVID respiratory disease trials had similarly low female leadership to COVID, suggesting field-specific gender pipelines[78].</li>
              <li>Trial type differences: Within COVID-19 trials, female leadership varied by intervention type. Women led a minority of drug trials (25.8% of drug trial PIs were women) and biologics/vaccine trials (27.9%), whereas they constituted the majority in behavioral intervention trials (56.8% led by women)[77]. This trend mirrors broader patterns where women are better represented in behavioral research fields.</li>
              <li>Leader gender &amp; participants: Among trials that reported participant gender breakdown, those with at least one female in the leadership team had on average 13.1% more women in their participant pool (p&lt;0.001)[76]. Even after adjusting for trial type, a smaller but significant association remained (~7.3% more women participants, p=0.036)[90]. This suggests female leadership might be linked to slightly better gender diversity in enrollment, though causation is not proven.</li>
              <li>Context and change: The initial gender gap in COVID trials (early on) aligns with hypotheses that emergency situations can sideline diversity. The later improvement by 2022 is encouraging and likely due to a combination of more women-led trials starting as the initial rush settled and possibly increased awareness of the issue. Nonetheless, COVID-19’s overall female leadership rate lagged behind other major disease areas, indicating room for improvement in ensuring women are equally leading high-profile research[72][91].</li>
