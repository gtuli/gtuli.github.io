        The Problem
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Traditional outbreak surveillance lags weeks behind, missing early signals of new threats.
        </li>
        <li>
         Critical signals spread across social media, web searches, and news are siloed and hard to monitor in real time.
        </li>
        <li>
         Novel bio-threats start with sparse, noisy digital indicators that conventional systems often overlook.

        The Solution
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Unified data pipeline continuously ingests multi-source feeds (Twitter, Google Trends, news) for anomaly detection.
        </li>
        <li>
         Tiered filtering by pathogen priority and source credibility isolates the most credible weak signals.
        </li>
        <li>
         Automated NLP and statistical algorithms flag unusual symptom clusters or location-based spikes in real time.

        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Modular cloud pipeline on AWS with engines for data extraction, enrichment, event detection, visualization, evaluation, and alert sharing.
        </li>
        <li>
         Real-time ingestion from APIs (Twitter, Google) and RSS feeds funnels into a processing queue with feedback loops to refine signal quality.
        </li>
        <li>
         Custom NLP enrichment and geo-clustering components clean data and add context (e.g., mapping tweets to locations) for accurate detection.
        </li>
        <li>
         An interactive dashboard displays mapped alerts and timelines, updating continuously for early situational awareness.
        </li>
        <li>
         A feedback mechanism updates keywords and data sources based on detected events, improving sensitivity over time.

        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Successfully flagged real events (e.g., Boston Marathon bombing, Hepatitis A outbreak) in retrospective tests, proving earlier detection than official reports.
        </li>
        <li>
         Outperformed 69 other solutions to win DHS’s Hidden Signal Challenge, earning national recognition and stakeholder buy-in (including a White House panel invitation).
        </li>
        <li>
         Delivered a functional prototype dashboard tested by public health officials, validating the tool’s practical use for early outbreak warning.
