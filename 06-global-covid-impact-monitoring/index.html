        The Problem
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Official reporting lagged or was inconsistent across countries, obscuring emerging hotspots.
        </li>
        <li>
         Uneven data quality made cross-country comparisons difficult for global health leaders.
        </li>
        <li>
         Policymakers needed privacy-conscious ways to leverage social survey data without compromising respondents.

        The Solution
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Scaled sampling, weighting, and translation operations to reach billions of daily impressions in dozens of languages.
