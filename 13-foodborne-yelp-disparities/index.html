         Analyzed 1.5 million Yelp restaurant reviews for food poisoning mentions to uncover public health underreporting disparities.
        </li>
        <li>
         Identified communities where people report illness online (via reviews) but not through official channels, highlighting equity issues in reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
         Provided data-driven insights to help health officials target outreach and improve food safety reporting in underserved areas.

        The Problem
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Reviews vs Reports Gap: Many diners post about getting sick in online reviews but never notify health authorities, creating an unseen pool of incidents.
        </li>
        <li>
         Potential disparities: Certain demographics or locales may rely on review sites instead of official channels, leaving public agencies unaware of issues in those populations.
        </li>
        <li>
         Missed signals: Traditional surveillance fails to capture these crowdsourced complaints, risking that outbreaks in some communities go unnoticed.

        The Solution
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Scraped and analyzed millions of Yelp reviews for keywords and narratives indicating foodborne illness experiences at restaurants.
        </li>
        <li>
         Compared the volume and pattern of Yelp-mentioned illness incidents with official food poisoning complaint data to quantify reporting gaps.
        </li>
        <li>
         Highlighted geographic and demographic patterns where many people complain online but far fewer file official reports, enabling health departments to identify where outreach or education is needed.

        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Data Collection: Implemented web scrapers to gather Yelp review data across numerous restaurants and regions, building a large dataset of customer feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
         NLP Extraction: Used text processing to detect mentions of food poisoning symptoms or complaints within reviews, filtering out unrelated content.
        </li>
        <li>
         Data Fusion: Matched the timeline and location of Yelp-indicated incidents with corresponding official public health reports to directly compare unofficial vs. official reporting rates.
        </li>
        <li>
         Statistical Analysis: Modeled factors (e.g., neighborhood income levels, restaurant types) associated with high Yelp complaint activity but low official reporting, to understand underlying causes of reporting disparities.
        </li>
        <li>
         Visualization: Created charts and heatmaps to illustrate areas of underreporting, helping stakeholders easily grasp the extent and location of the gaps.

        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Revealed hotspots where Yelp reviews indicated numerous illness incidents yet official reports were scarce, signaling critical underreporting in those areas.
        </li>
        <li>
         Demonstrated that lower-income and minority communities had disproportionately more unofficial (online) complaints relative to official reports, highlighting equity and trust gaps in public health reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
         Armed health authorities with concrete insights to focus education and outreach in communities with high “silent” complaint activity, with the goal of improving reporting rates and food safety interventions.
