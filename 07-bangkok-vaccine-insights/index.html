         Used Facebook’s city-scale digital health survey to rapidly assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy during Bangkok’s mid-2021 outbreak.
        </li>

         Showed vaccine hesitancy declined about 7% each week as vaccination rates climbed, indicating improving public acceptance over time.
        </li>
<li>
         Identified top hesitancy reasons (fear of side effects and “wait and see” caution) and revealed that 97% of respondents – even the hesitant – trusted health experts most for COVID information, guiding targeted public messaging.

<h2>
        The Problem
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         In mid-2021, Bangkok faced a severe COVID wave, but vaccine supply was limited and public uptake was slow, hampering outbreak control.
        </li>
<li>
         Even among high-priority groups (“608” – seniors or those with chronic conditions), many were reluctant to get vaccinated despite government incentives, threatening to prolong the crisis.
        </li>
<li>
         Policymakers lacked timely local data on the extent of hesitancy or the reasons behind it, leaving them unsure how to adjust their vaccination campaign strategy. Conducting large in-person surveys was impractical during an active outbreak, so a faster, resource-light solution was needed.
        </li>
</ul>
</section><section class="project-section">
<h2>
        The Solution
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Leveraged the ongoing University of Maryland/Facebook daily COVID survey to gather responses from Bangkok residents about their vaccination status, intentions, and attitudes, providing near real-time insight during the outbreak.
        </li>
<li>
         Ensured data quality by weighting the survey responses to match Bangkok’s demographics and priority group proportions, and by checking the survey’s reported vaccination rates against official data. This assured officials that the trends observed were credible and not skewed by sampling biases.
        </li>
<li>
         Tracked vaccine hesitancy and acceptance week by week through the outbreak and added specific questions to pinpoint why people were hesitant (multiple-choice reasons) and whom they trusted for information. Employed statistical analysis (e.g., Kendall tau correlations) to verify trends and relationships in the data, lending rigor to conclusions drawn for policy use.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Architecture Overview
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Data Collection Scale: Over ~34,000 survey responses were collected from Bangkok residents across five months, creating a rich dataset updated daily and aggregated weekly for analysis.
        </li>
<li>
         Representativeness Checks: Incorporated a routine to compare survey sample characteristics each week to known city population stats (age distribution, proportion of “608” high-risk individuals, etc.). If certain groups were underrepresented, weighting adjustments were applied so the results better reflected the actual population.
        </li>
<li>
         Automated Dashboard: Developed an internal dashboard that ingested weekly survey aggregates and displayed key metrics such as “% hesitant,” “% vaccinated,” and top reasons for hesitancy. This dashboard was shared with local health officials to quickly visualize how hesitancy was trending and which concerns were most cited, without waiting for a formal report.
        </li>
<li>
         Deep Dive Analysis: Used Python and R to conduct segmented analysis – for instance, splitting responses by age group or by hesitancy level to see if younger people had different concerns than older people. Performed chi-square tests to compare distributions of hesitancy reasons between groups, ensuring any highlighted differences were statistically significant and not due to chance.
        </li>
<li>
         Data Pipeline: The survey data (collected via Facebook) were accessed in batch form, then cleaned and aggregated. Each week’s results were appended to a time-series dataset. Scripts automated the generation of updated metrics and graphs, so that each week a fresh report could be delivered rapidly to city officials.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Results and Impacts
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         The survey achieved stable weekly sampling with respondent demographics that closely mirrored Bangkok’s population, giving confidence that the insights were broadly applicable. This consistency meant officials could trust that changes in the data reflected real shifts in public sentiment, not survey noise.
        </li>
<li>
         Self-reported vaccination rates in the survey increased in parallel with official vaccination statistics, while the proportion of people expressing hesitancy fell substantially week after week (roughly a 7% drop in hesitancy per week). This real-time evidence that hesitancy was declining helped reassure authorities that their outreach efforts were effective and encouraged them to stay the course and even intensify certain campaigns.
        </li>
<li>
         Crucially, the survey pinpointed why people were hesitant: the majority cited worries about side effects and a desire to “wait and see” as top reasons. Meanwhile, fringe anti-vaccine sentiments (like general anti-vax or religious objections) were very low (&lt;10%). This guided officials to focus communications on vaccine safety and to provide updates about others safely getting vaccinated, rather than battling broad conspiracy theories.
        </li>
<li>
         The finding that 96.9% of respondents trusted medical professionals and scientists (far more than other sources like politicians or social media) directly influenced the city’s public messaging strategy. Knowing this, health authorities leaned on doctors, nurses, and respected medical academics to be the spokespeople in TV and online campaigns, ensuring the messages came from voices the public would heed.

<h2>
        Cross-Project Capabilities
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Adaptable digital surveillance: showed how a global survey platform can be “zoomed in” to focus on a single locale’s needs, a flexibility he later applied to other projects (like tailoring survey-based methods to measure vaccine effectiveness in specific regions).
        </li>
<li>
         Behavioral insight generation: strengthened expertise in extracting and interpreting human behavioral and attitudinal data from large datasets – a capability useful across many domains, from patient experience analysis in hospitals to public opinion mining in different countries.
        </li>
<li>
         Cross-functional coordination: honed the ability to work in an interdisciplinary environment (epidemiologists, data scientists, government officials) and deliver results that satisfy all parties. This skill of aligning data science work with policy needs is a thread seen in many of Dr. Tuli’s projects.

        Published Papers/Tools
       </h2>
<ul>
<li>
         Peer-Reviewed Publication: JMIR Public Health and Surveillance (2023) – “COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Uptake in Bangkok, Thailand: Cross-sectional Online Survey.” This paper formally reports the study’s findings and methodology, contributing to the academic literature on urban vaccine hesitancy.
        </li>
<li>
         Policy Brief: Distilled the survey results into a concise policy report for Thailand’s health authorities. The brief highlighted the key drivers of hesitancy and recommended strategies (e.g., emphasize safety messaging, enlist healthcare professionals as communicators) to boost vaccine uptake, directly influencing the public health communication approach during the outbreak.
