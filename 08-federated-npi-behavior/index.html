              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Measuring masking/distancing at scale is hard: intrusive
                  tracking or biased self-reports.
                </li>
                <li>
                  COVID mobility data was too coarse to link behavior changes to
                  vaccination status.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Officials needed detailed behavior insights without
                  centralized sensitive data, risking distrust.
                </li>

              <h2>The Solution</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Used Google Health Studies with opt-in surveys and on-device
                  analysis; raw data stayed on phones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Applied differential privacy so shared aggregates couldn’t
                  expose individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Linked vaccination status locally to analyze behavioral shifts
                  anonymously.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Demonstrated federated designs can answer epidemiologic
                  questions without central data.

              <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Phones acted as local nodes processing surveys and any sensor
                  data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Secure aggregation returned only encrypted, population-level
                  totals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added calibrated DP noise to obscure unique contributions
                  while preserving signal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Validated with participation thresholds and simulations to
                  test recovery of patterns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weekly federated rounds produced interpretable, time-trended
                  findings.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Masking/distancing stayed high until full vaccination;
                  resistant groups stayed low.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Showed vaccination didn’t trigger early drop-offs; tailored
                  messaging needed for resisters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Proved large-scale, privacy-preserving research feasible in
