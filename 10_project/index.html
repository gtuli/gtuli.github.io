            <h2>BLUF</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Used Facebook’s global COVID survey data to develop a rapid method for estimating real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) as new variants (Delta, Omicron) emerged[93].</li>
              <li>Found that vaccine effectiveness dropped markedly (median ~40 percentage point decline) during Omicron-dominant waves compared to periods dominated by the earlier Delta variant[94]. Also observed a shift in predominant symptoms to mainly upper respiratory (cough, sore throat) during Omicron waves[95].</li>
              <li>Demonstrated that participatory survey data can provide timely VE insights in countries with limited testing, offering a valuable tool for global health response when traditional data are delayed[44].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>New variants like Omicron raised urgent questions about whether vaccines would remain as protective. Quickly detecting any drop in vaccine effectiveness (VE) with variant emergence is crucial for informing public health responses[96].</li>
              <li>Standard VE studies rely on lab-confirmed cases (cohort or case-control studies) and are often done retrospectively, resulting in a lag of weeks or months before effectiveness data catch up to a fast-spreading variant[97].</li>
              <li>Even real-time monitoring systems typically use some form of diagnostic testing data. However, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) struggle to scale up testing, meaning traditional VE assessments might miss or delay insights in those settings[98].</li>
              <li>Leveraging digital health data – specifically, self-reported symptoms and vaccination status from a global social media-based survey – offered a potential way to estimate changes in vaccine performance more rapidly and in places with sparse testing[99][44].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Key Questions Addressed</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Did COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness decline with the emergence of the Omicron variant compared to the earlier Delta variant period, and if so, by how much?[94]</li>
              <li>Did the clinical presentation of COVID-19 (symptoms reported) change during Omicron waves (e.g., more cough and sore throat) compared to previous waves, indicating a shift in symptomatology?[95]</li>
              <li>Can vaccine effectiveness be estimated using self-reported survey data (symptoms and vaccine status) in near real-time, even in settings lacking extensive PCR testing?[44]</li>
              <li>Does vaccine-derived protection during Omicron waves differ by illness severity (e.g., does it prevent severe outcomes as well as mild ones)?[100]</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Variant uncertainty: When Omicron emerged, it was unclear if vaccines would hold up. Waiting for traditional studies meant a dangerous knowledge gap in the midst of a rapid global wave[96].</li>
              <li>Retrospective delays: Gold-standard VE studies are time-consuming and retrospective, causing a delay between a variant’s spread and actionable data on vaccine performance[101].</li>
              <li>Testing shortfalls: Many countries (especially LMICs) had limited COVID testing and sequencing, making it difficult to even identify who was infected with which variant, let alone measure vaccine efficacy in those populations[102].</li>
              <li>Data dependency: Existing monitoring methods were still bound to some diagnostic data, which could be incomplete or slow to obtain during a surge, hindering the global ability to quickly gauge vaccine protection against new variants[103].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Importance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Timely VE insights: Rapidly knowing that vaccine protection has dropped (e.g., with Omicron) allows health authorities to consider accelerating booster campaigns, updating vaccine formulations, or reinforcing other interventions sooner rather than later[96].</li>
              <li>Global health equity: A survey-based approach provides a way for countries with limited testing infrastructure to still assess vaccine performance in their population, so they are not left behind in understanding and responding to variant threats[44][102].</li>
              <li>Symptom shift awareness: Recognizing that Omicron causes different symptoms (more upper-respiratory, less loss of taste/smell perhaps) helps healthcare providers and the public adjust testing and treatment practices (for example, focusing on different clinical criteria for diagnosis)[95].</li>
              <li>Innovative surveillance: This project underscores the value of non-traditional data sources in pandemic monitoring. It opens the door for using similar digital methods to track effectiveness of interventions in future outbreaks, thereby complementing classical epidemiological studies[44].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Data source: Utilized the <strong>University of Maryland COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS)</strong> on Facebook to gather near-real-time data on self-reported COVID-like illness and vaccination status from respondents in three middle-income countries (Guatemala, Mexico, South Africa)[43]. These countries were chosen for having Omicron and Delta waves and representing settings with limited testing.</li>
              <li>Case-control approach via survey: Developed a method to estimate vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of self-reported COVID-like illness between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Essentially, treated survey respondents with symptoms as “cases” and those without as “controls,” and used vaccination status to compute an odds ratio for illness[104][105].</li>
              <li>Conditional logistic regression: Implemented a conditional logistic regression model (to mimic a matched case-control) conditioned on factors like time and location, which produced estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) for different periods (Delta-dominant vs Omicron-dominant)[105].</li>
              <li>Variant period analysis: Split the dataset into time periods corresponding to when Delta was the dominant variant and when Omicron was dominant in each country (based on external variant prevalence data). Calculated the VE in each period and then the change in VE between periods[106].</li>
              <li>Symptom analysis: Analyzed the types of symptoms reported by respondents during Delta vs Omicron waves. Looked for shifts, such as an increase in reports of cough and sore throat (upper respiratory symptoms) during Omicron surges, indicating a possible change in the symptom profile of COVID-19[95].</li>
              <li>Severity stratification: Classified self-reported illnesses by severity using NIH definitions (e.g., mild vs severe symptoms) and computed VE for each severity category during Omicron to see if vaccines were still preventing severe illness effectively[100].</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Survey data pipeline: Continuously collected survey responses via Facebook’s platform, with thousands of responses per country per day. Data included respondents’ demographic info, vaccination status, and any COVID-like symptoms in the past day, feeding into a central analysis repository.</li>
              <li>Data preprocessing: Applied survey weights to adjust for sampling bias and ensured consistent definition of “COVID-like illness” across datasets. Marked periods by variant dominance using global and national genomic surveillance reports to label survey data time frames (Delta vs Omicron periods)[94].</li>
              <li>Modeling: Used R’s survival/epidemiology packages to run conditional logistic regression on the weighted survey data. The model output provided an estimated odds ratio of illness for vaccinated vs unvaccinated for each period, which was converted to VE (% reduction in odds of illness due to vaccination)[105].</li>
              <li>Comparative analysis: Computed the difference in VE between Delta and Omicron periods (with median and IQR across different definitions of illness, to ensure robustness)[94]. Also performed sensitivity analyses by varying the symptom definitions for “case” (e.g., any CLI vs stricter symptom criteria) to test consistency of results.</li>
              <li>Symptom trend tool: Aggregated symptom reports to observe frequency of specific symptoms (fever, cough, loss of smell, etc.) in each variant wave. This was output as a comparative table or chart highlighting increases in upper respiratory symptoms during Omicron[95].</li>
              <li>Dashboard for stakeholders: Created an internal results dashboard that allowed exploring VE estimates by country and time, and visualizing the symptom shifts, to communicate findings with global health partners (e.g., WHO or national ministries) quickly while the formal publication was in process.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Results and Impacts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Omicron reduced vaccine effectiveness: The analysis showed a clear drop in vaccine effectiveness during Omicron waves. Quantitatively, there was roughly a 0.40 (40 percentage point) decrease in VE when comparing Omicron periods to Delta periods across various illness definitions (e.g., if VE was ~0.8 during Delta, it dropped to ~0.4 during Omicron)[94]. This confirmed that Omicron’s immune evasion translated to significantly less protection from prior vaccination in terms of preventing symptomatic illness.</li>
              <li>Symptom profile change: There was a notable shift in symptoms during Omicron-dominant times – respondents reported relatively more <strong>upper respiratory symptoms</strong> like cough and sore throat, and presumably fewer lower-respiratory or loss-of-taste symptoms, aligning with clinical observations that Omicron often presented as a milder, cold-like illness[95]. This finding reinforced clinical reports and provided population-level evidence of a change in COVID’s symptomatology with Omicron.</li>
              <li>VE across severities: The study found that vaccines continued to offer similar protection across different levels of illness severity during Omicron waves[100]. In other words, the reduction in VE affected mild and severe symptom categories roughly equally (and importantly, vaccines still provided substantial protection against severe symptoms, even if overall VE against infection was lower). This underscores that vaccination remained critical for preventing serious outcomes, even if breakthrough mild infections became more common with Omicron.</li>
              <li>Rapid, actionable insights: These results were obtained and circulated while Omicron waves were ongoing, offering health authorities timely information. For example, knowing the ~40% drop in VE could justify urgent rollout of booster doses or variant-specific vaccines. Similarly, understanding that Omicron causes mainly mild upper-respiratory symptoms might influence testing guidelines (to not rely only on loss of smell, for instance).</li>
              <li>Impact on global surveillance: The success of this approach demonstrated to international agencies that <strong>digital participatory surveillance can fill critical information gaps</strong>. It has prompted discussions about maintaining such survey systems post-pandemic for other diseases, and integrating them as an official component of global health monitoring for rapid VE assessment when new pathogens or variants emerge.</li>

            <h2>Skills and Tools Used</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Epidemiological analysis: Applied case-control study principles to a novel data source, showcasing ability to adapt epidemiological methods (like odds ratios for VE) to non-traditional datasets and still derive valid conclusions.</li>
              <li>Statistical programming: Used R (and Python) for heavy data lifting – from cleaning millions of survey records to performing conditional logistic regressions and generating confidence intervals for VE estimates. This required proficiency in packages for survey analysis and epidemiology.</li>
              <li>Data science creativity: Engineered proxy measures (self-reported CLI as a stand-in for lab-confirmed cases) to work around data limitations, demonstrating innovative problem-solving skills in data-limited environments.</li>
              <li>Cross-disciplinary integration: Combined knowledge of virology (variant characteristics), immunology (vaccine expected performance), and biostatistics. This interdisciplinary skill was vital to correctly interpret results (e.g., understanding why Omicron might cause more upper respiratory symptoms helped inform the analysis focus).</li>
              <li>Communication of complex results: Translated the findings into clear messages and visualizations for stakeholders (ministry officials, global health experts), emphasizing actionable points. This included explaining statistical uncertainty and limitations (like acknowledging survey bias or lack of confirmatory testing) in an understandable way to non-data-experts.</li>
